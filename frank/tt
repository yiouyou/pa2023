Azure managed disks are block-level storage volumes that are managed by Azure and used with Azure Virtual Machines. Managed disks are like a physical disk in an on-premises server but, virtualized. With managed disks, all you have to do is specify the disk size, the disk type, and provision the disk. Once you provision the disk, Azure handles the rest.  
The available types of disks are ultra disks, premium solid-state drives (SSD), standard SSDs, and standard hard disk drives (HDD). For information about each individual disk type, see [Select a disk type for IaaS VMs](disks-types).

Azure Managed Disks have the following cost drivers:

1. Disk size: There is a fixed cost for each disk size, which comes provisioned with specific limits on IOPS and throughput.
2. Outbound bandwidth: Costs are incurred for data transfer out of the disk.
3. Snapshot capacity: Costs are associated with storing snapshots of the disk.
4. On-demand bursting (if applicable): Additional costs may apply if the disk utilizes on-demand bursting.

Please note that the pricing details may vary, so it is recommended to refer to the Azure pricing page for the most up-to-date information.

Azure offers metrics in the Azure portal that provide insight on how your virtual machines (VM) and disks perform. The metrics can also be retrieved through an API call. This article is broken into 3 subsections:  
* **Disk IO, throughput and queue depth metrics** - These metrics allow you to see the storage performance from the perspective of a disk and a virtual machine.
* **Disk bursting metrics** - These are the metrics provide observability into our [bursting](disk-bursting) feature on our premium disks.
* **Storage IO utilization metrics** - These metrics help diagnose bottlenecks in your storage performance with disks.  
All metrics are emitted every minute, except for the bursting credit percentage metric, which is emitted every 5 minutes.

The performance of your Azure managed disk is set when you create your disk, in the form of its performance tier. The performance tier determines the IOPS and throughput your managed disk has. When you set the provisioned size of your disk, a performance tier is automatically selected. The performance tier can be changed at deployment or afterwards, without changing the size of the disk and without downtime. To learn more about performance tiers, see [Performance tiers for managed disks](disks-change-performance).  
Changing your performance tier has billing implications. See [Billing impact](disks-change-performance#billing-impact) for details.

Azure managed disks have the following performance metrics:

1. Disk IO: This metric allows you to see the storage performance from the perspective of a disk and a virtual machine.
2. Throughput: This metric measures the amount of data that can be transferred to and from the disk per unit of time.
3. Queue Depth: This metric indicates the number of pending I/O requests in the disk queue.

Additionally, there are bursting metrics that provide observability into the bursting feature on premium disks, and storage IO utilization metrics that help diagnose bottlenecks in storage performance.
