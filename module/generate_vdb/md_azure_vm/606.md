Scheduled Events is an Azure Metadata Service that gives your application time to prepare for virtual machine (VM) maintenance. It provides information about upcoming maintenance events (for example, reboot) so that your application can prepare for them and limit disruption. It's available for all Azure Virtual Machines types, including PaaS and IaaS on both Windows and Linux.

For information about Scheduled Events on Linux, see [Scheduled Events for Linux VMs](../linux/scheduled-events).

Scheduled events provide proactive notifications about upcoming events, for reactive information about events that have already happened see [VM availability information in Azure Resource Graph](../resource-graph-availability) and [Create availability alert rule for Azure virtual machine](../../azure-monitor/vm/tutorial-monitor-vm-alert-availability).

Note

Scheduled Events is generally available in all Azure Regions. See [Version and Region Availability](#version-and-region-availability) for latest release information.

## Why use Scheduled Events?

Many applications can benefit from time to prepare for VM maintenance. The time can be used to perform application-specific tasks that improve availability, reliability, and serviceability, including:

* Checkpoint and restore.
* Connection draining.
* Primary replica failover.
* Removal from a load balancer pool.
* Event logging.
* Graceful shutdown.

With Scheduled Events, your application can discover when maintenance will occur and trigger tasks to limit its impact.

Scheduled Events provides events in the following use cases:

* [Platform initiated maintenance](../maintenance-and-updates?bc=/azure/virtual-machines/windows/breadcrumb/toc.json&toc=/azure/virtual-machines/windows/toc.json) (for example, VM reboot, live migration or memory preserving updates for host).
* Virtual machine is running on [degraded host hardware](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/find-out-when-your-virtual-machine-hardware-is-degraded-with-scheduled-events) that is predicted to fail soon.
* Virtual machine was running on a host that suffered a hardware failure.
* User-initiated maintenance (for example, a user restarts or redeploys a VM).
* [Spot VM](../spot-vms) and [Spot scale set](../../virtual-machine-scale-sets/use-spot) instance evictions.

## The Basics

Metadata Service exposes information about running VMs by using a REST endpoint that's accessible from within the VM. The information is available via a nonroutable IP so that it's not exposed outside the VM.

### Scope

Scheduled events are delivered to and can be acknowledged by:

* Standalone Virtual Machines.
* All the VMs in an [Azure cloud service (classic)](../../cloud-services/).
* All the VMs in an availability set.
* All the VMs in a scale set placement group.

Note

Scheduled Events for all virtual machines (VMs) in a Fabric Controller (FC) tenant are delivered to all VMs in a FC tenant. FC tenant equates to a standalone VM, an entire Cloud Service, an entire Availability Set, and a Placement Group for a VM Scale Set (VMSS) regardless of Availability Zone usage.

As a result, check the `Resources` field in the event to identify which VMs are affected.

### Endpoint discovery

For VNET enabled VMs, Metadata Service is available from a static nonroutable IP, `169.254.169.254`. The full endpoint for the latest version of Scheduled Events is:

> 
> `http://169.254.169.254/metadata/scheduledevents?api-version=2020-07-01`
> 
> 
> 

If the VM isn't created within a Virtual Network, the default cases for cloud services and classic VMs, additional logic is required to discover the IP address to use.
To learn how to [discover the host endpoint](https://github.com/azure-samples/virtual-machines-python-scheduled-events-discover-endpoint-for-non-vnet-vm), see this sample.

### Version and region availability

The Scheduled Events service is versioned. Versions are mandatory; the current version is `2020-07-01`.

Note

Previous preview releases of Scheduled Events supported {latest} as the api-version. This format is no longer supported and will be deprecated in the future.

### Enabling and disabling Scheduled Events

Scheduled Events is enabled for your service the first time you make a request for events. You should expect a delayed response in your first call of up to two minutes. Scheduled Events is disabled for your service if it doesn't make a request to the endpoint for 24 hours.

### User-initiated maintenance

User-initiated VM maintenance via the Azure portal, API, CLI, or PowerShell results in a scheduled event. You then can test the maintenance preparation logic in your application, and your application can prepare for user-initiated maintenance.

If you restart a VM, an event with the type `Reboot` is scheduled. If you redeploy a VM, an event with the type `Redeploy` is scheduled. Typically events with a user event source can be immediately approved to avoid a delay on user-initiated actions. We advise having a primary and secondary VM communicating and approving user generated scheduled events in case the primary VM becomes unresponsive. This will prevent delays in recovering your application back to a good state.

Scheduled events are disabled by default for [VMSS Guest OS upgrades or reimages](../../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-automatic-upgrade). To enable scheduled events for these operations, first enable them using [OSImageNotificationProfile](/en-us/rest/api/compute/virtual-machine-scale-sets/create-or-update?tabs=HTTP#osimagenotificationprofile).

## Use the API

### Headers

When you query Metadata Service, you must provide the header `Metadata:true` to ensure the request wasn't unintentionally redirected. The `Metadata:true` header is required for all scheduled events requests. Failure to include the header in the request results in a "Bad Request" response from Metadata Service.

### Query for events

You can query for scheduled events by making the following call:

#### Bash sample

```
curl -H Metadata:true http://169.254.169.254/metadata/scheduledevents?api-version=2020-07-01

```

#### PowerShell sample

```
Invoke-RestMethod -Headers @{"Metadata"="true"} -Method GET -Uri "http://169.254.169.254/metadata/scheduledevents?api-version=2020-07-01" | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 64

```

#### Python sample

```
import json
import requests

metadata_url ="http://169.254.169.254/metadata/scheduledevents"
header = {'Metadata' : 'true'}
query_params = {'api-version':'2020-07-01'}

def get_scheduled_events():           
    resp = requests.get(metadata_url, headers = header, params = query_params)
    data = resp.json()
    return data

```

A response contains an array of scheduled events. An empty array means that currently no events are scheduled.
In the case where there are scheduled events, the response contains an array of events.

```
{
    "DocumentIncarnation": {IncarnationID},
    "Events": [
        {
            "EventId": {eventID},
            "EventType": "Reboot" | "Redeploy" | "Freeze" | "Preempt" | "Terminate",
            "ResourceType": "VirtualMachine",
            "Resources": [{resourceName}],
            "EventStatus": "Scheduled" | "Started",
            "NotBefore": {timeInUTC},       
            "Description": {eventDescription},
            "EventSource" : "Platform" | "User",
            "DurationInSeconds" : {timeInSeconds},
        }
    ]
}

```

### Event properties

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Document Incarnation | Integer that increases when the events array changes. Documents with the same incarnation contain the same event information, and the incarnation will be incremented when an event changes. |
| EventId | Globally unique identifier for this event.  Example: * 602d9444-d2cd-49c7-8624-8643e7171297
 |
| EventType | Impact this event causes.  Values: * `Freeze`: The Virtual Machine is scheduled to pause for a few seconds. CPU and network connectivity may be suspended, but there's no impact on memory or open files.* `Reboot`: The Virtual Machine is scheduled for reboot (non-persistent memory is lost). * `Redeploy`: The Virtual Machine is scheduled to move to another node (ephemeral disks are lost). * `Preempt`: The Spot Virtual Machine is being deleted (ephemeral disks are lost). This event is made available on a best effort basis * `Terminate`: The virtual machine is scheduled to be deleted.
 |
| ResourceType | Type of resource this event affects.  Values: * `VirtualMachine`
 |
| Resources | List of resources this event affects.  Example: * ["FrontEnd\_IN\_0", "BackEnd\_IN\_0"]
 |
| EventStatus | Status of this event.  Values: * `Scheduled`: This event is scheduled to start after the time specified in the `NotBefore` property.* `Started`: This event has started.

 No `Completed` or similar status is ever provided. The event is no longer returned when the event is finished. |
| NotBefore | Time after which this event can start. The event is guaranteed to not start before this time. Will be blank if the event has already started  Example: * Mon, 19 Sep 2016 18:29:47 GMT
 |
| Description | Description of this event.  Example: * Host server is undergoing maintenance.
 |
| EventSource | Initiator of the event.  Example: * `Platform`: This event is initiated by platform. * `User`: This event is initiated by user.
 |
| DurationInSeconds | The expected duration of the interruption caused by the event.  Example: * `9`: The interruption caused by the event will last for 9 seconds. * `0`: The event won't interrupt the VM or impact its availability (eg. update to the network) * `-1`: The default value used if the impact duration is either unknown or not applicable.
 |

### Event scheduling

Each event is scheduled a minimum amount of time in the future based on the event type. This time is reflected in an event's `NotBefore` property.

| EventType | Minimum notice |
| --- | --- |
| Freeze | 15 minutes |
| Reboot | 15 minutes |
| Redeploy | 10 minutes |
| Terminate | [User Configurable](../../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-terminate-notification#enable-terminate-notifications): 5 to 15 minutes |

Once an event is scheduled, it will move into the `Started` state after it's been approved or the `NotBefore` time passes. However, in rare cases, the operation will be cancelled by Azure before it starts. In that case the event will be removed from the Events array, and the impact will not occur as previously scheduled.

Note

In some cases, Azure is able to predict host failure due to degraded hardware and will attempt to mitigate disruption to your service by scheduling a migration. Affected virtual machines will receive a scheduled event with a `NotBefore` that is typically a few days in the future. The actual time varies depending on the predicted failure risk assessment. Azure tries to give 7 days' advance notice when possible, but the actual time varies and might be smaller if the prediction is that there's a high chance of the hardware failing imminently. To minimize risk to your service in case the hardware fails before the system-initiated migration, we recommend that you self-redeploy your virtual machine as soon as possible.

Note

In the case the host node experiences a hardware failure Azure will bypass the minimum notice period an immediately begin the recovery process for affected virtual machines. This reduces recovery time in the case that the affected VMs are unable to respond. During the recovery process an event will be created for all impacted VMs with `EventType = Reboot` and `EventStatus = Started`.

### Polling frequency

You can poll the endpoint for updates as frequently or infrequently as you like. However, the longer the time between requests, the more time you potentially lose to react to an upcoming event. Most events have 5 to 15 minutes of advance notice, although in some cases advance notice might be as little as 30 seconds. To ensure that you have as much time as possible to take mitigating actions, we recommend that you poll the service once per second.

### Start an event

After you learn of an upcoming event and finish your logic for graceful shutdown, you can approve the outstanding event by making a `POST` call to Metadata Service with `EventId`. This call indicates to Azure that it can shorten the minimum notification time (when possible). The event may not start immediately upon approval, in some cases Azure will require the approval of all the VMs hosted on the node before proceeding with the event.

The following JSON sample is expected in the `POST` request body. The request should contain a list of `StartRequests`. Each `StartRequest` contains `EventId` for the event you want to expedite:

```
{
	"StartRequests" : [
		{
			"EventId": {EventId}
		}
	]
}

```

The service will always return a 200 success code in the case of a valid event ID, even if it was already approved by a different VM. A 400 error code indicates that the request header or payload was malformed.

Note

Events will not proceed unless they are either approved via a POST message or the NotBefore time elapses. This includes user triggered events such as VM restarts from the Azure portal.

#### Bash sample

```
curl -H Metadata:true -X POST -d '{"StartRequests": [{"EventId": "f020ba2e-3bc0-4c40-a10b-86575a9eabd5"}]}' http://169.254.169.254/metadata/scheduledevents?api-version=2020-07-01

```

#### PowerShell sample

```
Invoke-RestMethod -Headers @{"Metadata" = "true"} -Method POST -body '{"StartRequests": [{"EventId": "5DD55B64-45AD-49D3-BBC9-F57D4EA97BD7"}]}' -Uri http://169.254.169.254/metadata/scheduledevents?api-version=2020-07-01 | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 64

```

#### Python sample

```
import json
import requests

def confirm_scheduled_event(event_id):  
   # This payload confirms a single event with id event_id
   payload = json.dumps({"StartRequests": [{"EventId": event_id }]})
   response = requests.post("http://169.254.169.254/metadata/scheduledevents", 
                            headers =  {'Metadata' : 'true'}, 
                            params = {'api-version':'2020-07-01'}, 
                            data = payload)    
   return response.status_code

```

Note

Acknowledging an event allows the event to proceed for all `Resources` in the event, not just the VM that acknowledges the event. Therefore, you can choose to elect a leader to coordinate the acknowledgement, which might be as simple as the first machine in the `Resources` field.

## Example responses

The following is an example of a series of events that were seen by two VMs that were live migrated to another node.

The `DocumentIncarnation` is changing every time there is new information in `Events`. An approval of the event would allow the freeze to proceed for both WestNO\_0 and WestNO\_1. The `DurationInSeconds` of -1 indicates that the platform doesn't know how long the operation will take.

```

    "DocumentIncarnation":  1,
    "Events":  [
               ]
}

                                         "WestNO_1"
                                     ],

               ]
}

{
    "DocumentIncarnation":  4,
    "Events":  [
               ]
}

```

## Python Sample

The following sample queries Metadata Service for scheduled events and approves each outstanding event:

```
#!/usr/bin/python
import json
import requests
from time import sleep

# The URL to access the metadata service
metadata_url ="http://169.254.169.254/metadata/scheduledevents"
# This must be sent otherwise the request will be ignored
header = {'Metadata' : 'true'}
# Current version of the API
query_params = {'api-version':'2020-07-01'}

            int(event["DurationInSeconds"]) >= 0  and 
            int(event["DurationInSeconds"]) < 9):
            confirm_scheduled_event(event["EventId"])

        # Events that may be impactful (eg. Reboot or redeploy) may need custom 
        # handling for your application
        else:

        Press 1 to poll for new events \n\
        Press 2 to exit \n "
    program_exit = False 

    while program_exit == False:
        user_input = input(input_text)

        elif (user_input == "2"):
            program_exit = True       

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
