When you enable encryption at host, data stored on the VM host is encrypted at rest and flows encrypted to the Storage service. For conceptual information on encryption at host, and other managed disk encryption types, see: [Encryption at host - End-to-end encryption for your VM data](disk-encryption#encryption-at-host---end-to-end-encryption-for-your-vm-data).

Temporary disks and ephemeral OS disks are encrypted at rest with platform-managed keys when you enable end-to-end encryption. The OS and data disk caches are encrypted at rest with either customer-managed or platform-managed keys, depending on what you select as the disk encryption type. For example, if a disk is encrypted with customer-managed keys, then the cache for the disk is encrypted with customer-managed keys, and if a disk is encrypted with platform-managed keys then the cache for the disk is encrypted with platform-managed keys.

## Restrictions

* Doesn't support ultra disks or premium SSD v2 managed disks.
* Can't be enabled if Azure Disk Encryption (guest-VM encryption using bitlocker/DM-Crypt) is enabled on your virtual machines (VMs) or virtual machine scale sets.
* Azure Disk Encryption can't be enabled on disks that have encryption at host enabled.
* The encryption can be enabled on existing virtual machine scale sets. However, only new VMs created after enabling the encryption are automatically encrypted.
* Existing VMs must be deallocated and reallocated in order to be encrypted.

### Supported VM sizes

Legacy VM Sizes aren't supported. You can find the list of supported VM sizes by either using the [Azure PowerShell module](windows/disks-enable-host-based-encryption-powershell#finding-supported-vm-sizes) or [Azure CLI](linux/disks-enable-host-based-encryption-cli#finding-supported-vm-sizes).

## Prerequisites

You must enable the feature for your subscription before you can use encryption at host for either your VM or Virtual Machine Scale Set. Use the following steps to enable the feature for your subscription:

1. **Azure portal**: Select the Cloud Shell icon on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com):

![Screenshot of icon to launch the Cloud Shell from the Azure portal.](media/disks-enable-host-based-encryption-portal/portal-launch-icon.png)
2. Execute the following command to register the feature for your subscription

	* [Azure PowerShell](#tabpanel_1_azure-powershell)
	* [Azure CLI](#tabpanel_1_azure-cli)

```
Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName "EncryptionAtHost" -ProviderNamespace "Microsoft.Compute"

```

```
az feature register --name EncryptionAtHost  --namespace Microsoft.Compute

```
3. Confirm that the registration state is **Registered** (registration may take a few minutes) using the following command before trying out the feature.

	* [Azure PowerShell](#tabpanel_2_azure-powershell)
	* [Azure CLI](#tabpanel_2_azure-cli)

```
Get-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName "EncryptionAtHost" -ProviderNamespace "Microsoft.Compute"

```

```
az feature show --name EncryptionAtHost --namespace Microsoft.Compute

```

## Deploy a VM with platform-managed keys

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Search for **Virtual Machines** and select **+ Create** to create a VM.
3. Select an appropriate region and a supported VM size.
4. Fill in the other values on the **Basic** pane as you like, and then proceed to the **Disks** pane.

5. On the **Disks** pane, select **Encryption at host**.
6. Make the remaining selections as you like.

[![Screenshot of the virtual machine creation disks pane, encryption at host highlighted.](media/virtual-machines-disks-encryption-at-host-portal/host-based-encryption-platform-keys.png)](media/virtual-machines-disks-encryption-at-host-portal/host-based-encryption-platform-keys.png#lightbox)
7. For the rest of the VM deployment process, make selections that fit your environment, and complete the deployment.

You've now deployed a VM with encryption at host enabled, and the cache for the disk is encrypted using platform-managed keys.

## Deploy a VM with customer-managed keys

Alternatively, you can use customer-managed keys to encrypt your disk caches.

### Create an Azure Key Vault and disk encryption set

Once the feature is enabled, you need to set up an Azure Key Vault and a disk encryption set, if you haven't already.

Setting up customer-managed keys for your disks requires you to create resources in a particular order, if you're doing it for the first time. First, you'll need to create and set up an Azure Key Vault.

## Set up your Azure Key Vault

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Search for and select **Key Vaults**.

[![Screenshot of the Azure portal with the search dialog box expanded.](../includes/media/virtual-machines-disk-encryption-portal/server-side-encryption-key-vault-portal-search.png)](../includes/media/virtual-machines-disk-encryption-portal/sever-side-encryption-key-vault-portal-search-expanded.png#lightbox)

Important

Your disk encryption set, VM, disks, and snapshots must all be in the same region and subscription for deployment to succeed. Azure Key Vaults may be used from a different subscription but must be in the same region and tenant as your disk encryption set.
3. Select **+Create** to create a new Key Vault.
4. Create a new resource group.
5. Enter a key vault name, select a region, and select a pricing tier.

Note

When creating the Key Vault instance, you must enable soft delete and purge protection. Soft delete ensures that the Key Vault holds a deleted key for a given retention period (90 day default). Purge protection ensures that a deleted key cannot be permanently deleted until the retention period lapses. These settings protect you from losing data due to accidental deletion. These settings are mandatory when using a Key Vault for encrypting managed disks.
6. Select **Review + Create**, verify your choices, then select **Create**.

[![Screenshot of the Azure Key Vault creation experience, showing the particular values you create.](../includes/media/virtual-machines-disk-encryption-portal/server-side-encryption-create-a-key-vault.png)](../includes/media/virtual-machines-disk-encryption-portal/server-side-encryption-create-a-key-vault.png#lightbox)
7. Once your key vault finishes deploying, select it.
8. Select **Keys** under **Objects**.
9. Select **Generate/Import**.

[![Screenshot of the Key Vault resource settings pane, shows the generate/import button inside settings.](../includes/media/virtual-machines-disk-encryption-portal/server-side-encryption-key-vault-generate-settings.png)](../includes/media/virtual-machines-disk-encryption-portal/server-side-encryption-key-vault-generate-settings.png#lightbox)
10. Leave both **Key Type** set to **RSA** and **RSA Key Size** set to **2048**.
11. Fill in the remaining selections as you like and then select **Create**.

[![Screenshot of the create a key pane that appears once generate/import button is selected.](../includes/media/virtual-machines-disk-encryption-portal/server-side-encryption-create-a-key-generate.png)](../includes/media/virtual-machines-disk-encryption-portal/server-side-encryption-create-a-key-generate.png#lightbox)

### Add an Azure RBAC role

Now that you've created the Azure key vault and a key, you must add an Azure RBAC role, so you can use your Azure key vault with your disk encryption set.

1. Select **Access control (IAM)** and add a role.
2. Add either the **Key Vault Administrator**, **Owner**, or **Contributor** roles.

## Set up your disk encryption set

1. Search for **Disk Encryption Sets** and select it.
2. On the **Disk Encryption Sets** pane, select **+Create**.
3. Select your resource group, name your encryption set, and select the same region as your key vault.
4. For **Encryption type**, select **Encryption at-rest with a customer-managed key**.

Note

Once you create a disk encryption set with a particular encryption type, it cannot be changed. If you want to use a different encryption type, you must create a new disk encryption set.
5. Make sure **Select Azure key vault and key** is selected.
6. Select the key vault and key you created previously, and the version.
7. If you want to enable [automatic rotation of customer managed keys](disk-encryption#automatic-key-rotation-of-customer-managed-keys), select **Auto key rotation**.
8. Select **Review + Create** and then **Create**.

9. Navigate to the disk encryption set once it's deployed, and select the displayed alert.

[![Screenshot of user selecting the 'To associate a disk, image, or snapshot with this disk encryption set, you must grant permissions to the key vault' alert.](../includes/media/virtual-machines-disk-encryption-portal/disk-encryption-set-perm-alert.png)](../includes/media/virtual-machines-disk-encryption-portal/disk-encryption-set-perm-alert.png#lightbox)
10. This will grant your key vault permissions to the disk encryption set.

[![Screenshot of confirmation that permissions have been granted.](../includes/media/virtual-machines-disk-encryption-portal/disk-encryption-set-perm-confirmation.png)](../includes/media/virtual-machines-disk-encryption-portal/disk-encryption-set-perm-confirmation.png#lightbox)

### Deploy a VM

Now that you have setup an Azure Key Vault and disk encryption set, you can deploy a VM and it uses encryption at host.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Search for **Virtual Machines** and select **+ Add** to create a VM.
3. Create a new virtual machine, select an appropriate region and a supported VM size.
4. Fill in the other values on the **Basic** pane as you like, then proceed to the **Disks** pane.

[![Screenshot of the virtual machine creation basics pane, region and VM size are highlighted.](media/virtual-machines-disks-encryption-at-host-portal/disks-encryption-at-host-basic-blade.png)](media/virtual-machines-disks-encryption-at-host-portal/disks-encryption-at-host-basic-blade.png#lightbox)
5. On the **Disks** pane, select **Encryption at host**.
6. Select **Key management** and select one of your customer-managed keys.
7. Make the remaining selections as you like.

[![Screenshot of the virtual machine creation disks pane, encryption at host is highlighted, customer-managed keys selected.](media/virtual-machines-disks-encryption-at-host-portal/disks-host-based-encryption-customer-managed-keys.png)](media/virtual-machines-disks-encryption-at-host-portal/disks-host-based-encryption-customer-managed-keys.png#lightbox)
8. For the rest of the VM deployment process, make selections that fit your environment, and complete the deployment.

You've now deployed a VM with encryption at host enabled using customer-managed keys.

## Disable host based encryption

Deallocate your VM first, encryption at host can't be disabled unless your VM is deallocated.

1. On your VM, select **Disks** and then select **Additional settings**.

![Screenshot of the Disks pane on a VM, Additional Settings is highlighted.](media/virtual-machines-disks-encryption-at-host-portal/disks-encryption-host-based-encryption-additional-settings.png)
2. Select **No** for **Encryption at host** then select **Save**.
