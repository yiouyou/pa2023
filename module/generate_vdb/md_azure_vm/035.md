## Operations

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Assess Patches](virtual-machines/assess-patches) | Assess patches on the VM. |
| [Capture](virtual-machines/capture) | Captures the VM by copying virtual hard disks of the VM and outputs a template that can be used to create similar VMs. |
| [Convert To Managed Disks](virtual-machines/convert-to-managed-disks) | Converts virtual machine disks from blob-based to managed disks. Virtual machine must be stop-deallocated before invoking this operation. |
| [Create Or Update](virtual-machines/create-or-update) | The operation to create or update a virtual machine. Please note some properties can be set only during virtual machine creation. |
| [Deallocate](virtual-machines/deallocate) | Shuts down the virtual machine and releases the compute resources. You are not billed for the compute resources that this virtual machine uses. |
| [Delete](virtual-machines/delete) | The operation to delete a virtual machine. |
| [Generalize](virtual-machines/generalize) | Sets the OS state of the virtual machine to generalized. It is recommended to sysprep the virtual machine before performing this operation. For Windows, please ... |
| [Get](virtual-machines/get) | Retrieves information about the model view or the instance view of a virtual machine. |
| [Install Patches](virtual-machines/install-patches) | Installs patches on the VM. |
| [Instance View](virtual-machines/instance-view) | Retrieves information about the run-time state of a virtual machine. |
| [List](virtual-machines/list) | Lists all of the virtual machines in the specified resource group. Use the nextLink property in the response to get the next page of virtual machines. |
| [List All](virtual-machines/list-all) | Lists all of the virtual machines in the specified subscription. Use the nextLink property in the response to get the next page of virtual machines. |
| [List Available Sizes](virtual-machines/list-available-sizes) | Lists all available virtual machine sizes to which the specified virtual machine can be resized. |
| [List By Location](virtual-machines/list-by-location) | Gets all the virtual machines under the specified subscription for the specified location. |
| [Perform Maintenance](virtual-machines/perform-maintenance) | The operation to perform maintenance on a virtual machine. |
| [Power Off](virtual-machines/power-off) | The operation to power off (stop) a virtual machine. The virtual machine can be restarted with the same provisioned resources. You are still charged for this vi... |
| [Reapply](virtual-machines/reapply) | The operation to reapply a virtual machine's state. |
| [Redeploy](virtual-machines/redeploy) | Shuts down the virtual machine, moves it to a new node, and powers it back on. |
| [Reimage](virtual-machines/reimage) | Reimages (upgrade the operating system) a virtual machine which don't have a ephemeral OS disk, for virtual machines who have a ephemeral OS disk the virtual ma... |
| [Restart](virtual-machines/restart) | The operation to restart a virtual machine. |
| [Retrieve Boot Diagnostics Data](virtual-machines/retrieve-boot-diagnostics-data) | The operation to retrieve SAS URIs for a virtual machine's boot diagnostic logs. |
| [Run Command](virtual-machines/run-command) | Run command on the VM. |
| [Simulate Eviction](virtual-machines/simulate-eviction) | The operation to simulate the eviction of spot virtual machine. |
| [Start](virtual-machines/start) | The operation to start a virtual machine. |
| [Update](virtual-machines/update) | The operation to update a virtual machine. |
