You can use the CLI to see when VMs are scheduled for [maintenance](maintenance-notifications). Planned maintenance information is available from [az vm get-instance-view](/en-us/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-get-instance-view).

Maintenance information is returned only if there is maintenance planned.

```
az vm get-instance-view -n myVM -g myResourceGroup --query instanceView.maintenanceRedeployStatus

```

Output

```
      "maintenanceRedeployStatus": {
      "additionalProperties": {},
      "isCustomerInitiatedMaintenanceAllowed": true,
      "lastOperationMessage": null,
      "lastOperationResultCode": "None",
      "maintenanceWindowEndTime": "2018-06-04T16:30:00+00:00",
      "maintenanceWindowStartTime": "2018-05-21T16:30:00+00:00",
      "preMaintenanceWindowEndTime": "2018-05-19T12:30:00+00:00",
      "preMaintenanceWindowStartTime": "2018-05-14T12:30:00+00:00"

```

## Start maintenance

The following call will start maintenance on a VM if `IsCustomerInitiatedMaintenanceAllowed` is set to true.

```
az vm perform-maintenance -g myResourceGroup -n myVM 

```

## Classic deployments

Important

VMs created through the classic deployment model will be retired on September 1, 2023.

If you use IaaS resources from Azure Service Management, please complete your migration by September 1, 2023. We encourage you to make the switch sooner to take advantage of the many feature enhancements in Azure Resource Manager.

For more information, see [Migrate your IaaS resources to Azure Resource Manager by September 1, 2023](classic-vm-deprecation).

If you still have legacy VMs that were deployed using the classic deployment model, you can use the Azure classic CLI to query for VMs and initiate maintenance.

Make sure you are in the correct mode to work with classic VM by typing:

```
azure config mode asm

```

To get the maintenance status of a VM named *myVM*, type:

```
azure vm show myVM 

```

To start maintenance on your classic VM named *myVM* in the *myService* service and *myDeployment* deployment, type:

```
azure compute virtual-machine initiate-maintenance --service-name myService --name myDeployment --virtual-machine-name myVM

```

## Next steps

You can also handle planned maintenance using the [Azure PowerShell](maintenance-notifications-powershell) or [portal](maintenance-notifications-portal).
