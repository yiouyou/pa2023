To learn more about [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) or troubleshoot it at a deeper level, you need to understand how it works. This document highlights the important parts, and explains the Azure specifics.

When cloud-init is included in a generalized image, and a VM is created from that image, it processes configurations and run-through five stages during the initial boot. These stages matter, as it shows you at what point cloud-init applies configurations.

## Understand Cloud-Init configuration

Configuring a VM to run on a platform, means cloud-init needs to apply multiple configurations, as an image consumer, the main configurations you interact with is `User data` (customData), which supports multiple formats. For more information, see [User-Data Formats & cloud-init 21.2 documentation](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/format.html#user-data-formats). You also have the ability to add and run scripts (/var/lib/cloud/scripts) for other configuration.

Some configurations are already baked into Azure Marketplace images that come with cloud-init, such as:

* **Cloud data source** - cloud-init contains code that can interact with cloud platforms, these codes are called 'datasources'. When a VM is created from a cloud-init image in [Azure](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/datasources/azure.html#azure), cloud-init loads the Azure datasource, which interacts with the Azure metadata endpoints to get the VM specific configuration.
* **Runtime config** (/run/cloud-init).
* **Image config** (/etc/cloud), like `/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg`, `/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/*.cfg`. An example of where this configuration is used in Azure, it's common for the Linux OS images with cloud-init to have an Azure datasource directive that tells cloud-init what datasource it should use, this configuration saves cloud-init time:

```
sudo cat /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/90_dpkg.cfg

```

```
# to update this file, run dpkg-reconfigure cloud-init
datasource_list: [ Azure ]

```

## Cloud-init boot stages (processing configuration)

When you are provisioning VMs with cloud-init, there are five stages of boot, which process configuration, and shown in the logs.

1. [Generator Stage](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/boot.html#generator): The cloud-init systemd generator starts, and determines that cloud-init should be included in the boot goals, and if so, it enables cloud-init.
2. [Cloud-init Local Stage](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/boot.html#local): Here cloud-init looks for the local "Azure" datasource, which enables cloud-init to interface with Azure, and apply a networking configuration, including fallback.
3. [Cloud-init init Stage (Network)](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/boot.html#network): Networking should be online, and the NIC and route table information should be generated. At this stage, the modules listed in `cloud_init_modules` in `/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg` runs. The VM in Azure is mounted, the ephemeral disk is formatted, the hostname is set, along with other tasks.

The following are some of the `cloud_init_modules`:

```
- migrator
- seed_random
- bootcmd
- write-files
- growpart
- resizefs
- disk_setup
- mounts
- set_hostname
- update_hostname
- ssh

```

After this stage, cloud-init sends a signal to the Azure platform that the VM has been provisioned successfully. Some modules may have failed, not all module failures result in a provisioning failure.
4. [Cloud-init Config Stage](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/boot.html#config): At this stage, the modules in `cloud_config_modules` defined and listed in `/etc/cloud/cloud`.cfg runs.
5. [Cloud-init Final Stage](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/boot.html#final): At this final stage, the modules in `cloud_final_modules`, listed in `/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg`, runs. Here modules that need to be run late in the boot process run, such as package installations and run scripts etc.

	* During this stage, you can run scripts by placing them in the directories under `/var/lib/cloud/scripts`:
		+ `per-boot` - scripts within this directory, run on every reboot
		+ `per-instance` - scripts within this directory run when a new instance is first booted
		+ `per-once` - scripts within this directory run only once
