## In this article

This article contains two scripts. The first script copies a managed disk that's using platform-managed keys to same or different subscription but in the same region. The second script copies a managed disk that's using customer-managed keys to the same or a different subscription in the same region. Either copy only works when the subscriptions are part of the same Azure AD tenant.

If you don't have an [Azure subscription](../../guides/developer/azure-developer-guide#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing), create an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

* Use the Bash environment in [Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see [Quickstart for Bash in Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).

[![](../../reusable-content/azure-cli/media/hdi-launch-cloud-shell.png)](https://shell.azure.com)
* If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally, [install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see [How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).

	+ If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the [az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see [Sign in with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).
	+ When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see [Use extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).
	+ Run [az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version) to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run [az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).

## Sample script

### Launch Azure Cloud Shell

The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell that you can use to run the steps in this article. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account.

To open the Cloud Shell, just select **Try it** from the upper right corner of a code block. You can also launch Cloud Shell in a separate browser tab by going to <https://shell.azure.com>.

When Cloud Shell opens, verify that **Bash** is selected for your environment. Subsequent sessions will use Azure CLI in a Bash environment, Select **Copy** to copy the blocks of code, paste it into the Cloud Shell, and press **Enter** to run it.

### Sign in to Azure

Cloud Shell is automatically authenticated under the initial account signed-in with. Use the following script to sign in using a different subscription, replacing `<Subscription ID>` with your Azure Subscription ID. If you don't have an [Azure subscription](../../guides/developer/azure-developer-guide#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing), create an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.

```
subscription="<subscriptionId>" # add subscription here

az account set -s $subscription # ...or use 'az login'

```

For more information, see [set active subscription](/en-us/cli/azure/account#az-account-set) or [log in interactively](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login)

### Disks with platform-managed keys

```

#Provide the subscription Id of the subscription where managed disk exists
sourceSubscriptionId="<subscriptionId>"

#Provide the name of your resource group where managed disk exists
sourceResourceGroupName=mySourceResourceGroupName

#Provide the name of the managed disk
managedDiskName=myDiskName

#Set the context to the subscription Id where managed disk exists
az account set --subscription $sourceSubscriptionId

#Get the managed disk Id 
managedDiskId=$(az disk show --name $managedDiskName --resource-group $sourceResourceGroupName --query [id] -o tsv)

#If managedDiskId is blank then it means that managed disk does not exist.
echo 'source managed disk Id is: ' $managedDiskId

#Provide the subscription Id of the subscription where managed disk will be copied to
targetSubscriptionId=6492b1f7-f219-446b-b509-314e17e1efb0

#Name of the resource group where managed disk will be copied to
targetResourceGroupName=mytargetResourceGroupName

#Set the context to the subscription Id where managed disk will be copied to
az account set --subscription $targetSubscriptionId

#Copy managed disk to different subscription using managed disk Id
az disk create --resource-group $targetResourceGroupName --name $managedDiskName --source $managedDiskId

```

### Disks with customer-managed keys

```
#Provide the subscription Id of the subscription where managed disk exists
sourceSubscriptionId="<subscriptionId>"

#Provide the name of your resource group where managed disk exists
sourceResourceGroupName=mySourceResourceGroupName

#Provide the name of the managed disk
managedDiskName=myDiskName

#Provide the name of the target disk encryption set
diskEncryptionSetName=myName

#Provide the target disk encryption set resource group
diskEncryptionResourceGroup=myGroup

#Set the context to the subscription Id where managed disk exists
az account set --subscription $sourceSubscriptionId

#Get the managed disk Id 
managedDiskId=$(az disk show --name $managedDiskName --resource-group $sourceResourceGroupName --query [id] -o tsv)

#If managedDiskId is blank then it means that managed disk does not exist.
echo 'source managed disk Id is: ' $managedDiskId

#Get the disk encryption set ID
diskEncryptionSetId=$(az disk-encryption-set show --name $diskEncryptionSetName --resource-group $diskEncryptionResourceGroup)

#Provide the subscription Id of the subscription where managed disk will be copied to
targetSubscriptionId=6492b1f7-f219-446b-b509-314e17e1efb0

#Name of the resource group where managed disk will be copied to
targetResourceGroupName=mytargetResourceGroupName

#Set the context to the subscription Id where managed disk will be copied to
az account set --subscription $targetSubscriptionId

#Copy managed disk to different subscription using managed disk Id and disk encryption set ID
#Add --location parameter to change the location
az disk create -g $targetResourceGroupName -n $managedDiskName --source $managedDiskId --disk-encryption-set $diskEncrpytonSetId

```

## Clean up resources

Run the following command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources.

```
az group delete --name mySourceResourceGroupName

```

## Sample reference

This script uses following commands to create a new managed disk in the target subscription using the `Id` of the source managed disk. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| [az disk show](/en-us/cli/azure/disk) | Gets all the properties of a managed disk using the name and resource group properties of the managed disk. The `Id` property is used to copy the managed disk to different subscription. |
| [az disk create](/en-us/cli/azure/disk) | Copies a managed disk by creating a new managed disk in different subscription using the `Id` and name the parent managed disk. |
