Maintenance Configurations gives you the ability to control and manage updates for many Azure virtual machine resources since Azure frequently updates its infrastructure to improve reliability, performance, security or launch new features. Most updates are transparent to users, but some sensitive workloads, like gaming, media streaming, and financial transactions, can't tolerate even few seconds of a VM freezing or disconnecting for maintenance. Maintenance Configurations is integrated with Azure Resource Graph (ARG) for low latency and high scale customer experience.

Important

Users are required to have a role of at least contributor in order to use maintenance configurations. Users also have to ensure that their subscription is registered with Maintenance Resource Provider to use maintenance configurations.

## Scopes

Maintenance Configurations currently supports three (3) scopes: Host, OS image, and Guest. While each scope allows scheduling and managing updates, the major difference lies in the resource they each support. This section outlines the details on the various scopes and their supported types:

| Scope | Support Resources |
| --- | --- |
| Host | Isolated Virtual Machines, Isolated Virtual Machine Scale Sets, Dedicated Hosts |
| OS Image | Virtual Machine Scale Sets |
| Guest | Virtual Machines, Azure Arc Servers |

### Host

With this scope, you can manage platform updates that do not require a reboot on your *isolated VMs*, *isolated Virtual Machine Scale Set instances* and *dedicated hosts*. Some features and limitations unique to the host scope are:

* Schedules can be set anytime within 35 days. After 35 days, updates are automatically applied.
* A minimum of a 2 hour maintenance window is required for this scope.
* Rack level maintenance is not currently supported.

### OS image

Using this scope with maintenance configurations lets you decide when to apply upgrades to OS disks in your *Virtual Machine Scale Sets* through an easier and more predictable experience. An upgrade works by replacing the OS disk of a VM with a new disk created using the latest image version. Any configured extensions and custom data scripts are run on the OS disk, while data disks are retained. Some features and limitations unique to this scope are:

* Scale sets need to have [automatic OS upgrades](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-automatic-upgrade) enabled in order to use maintenance configurations.
* You can schedule recurrence up to a week (7 days).
* A minimum of 5 hours is required for the maintenance window.

### Guest

This scope is integrated with [update management center](../update-center/overview), which allows you to save recurring deployment schedules to install updates for your Windows Server and Linux machines in Azure, in on-premises environments, and in other cloud environments connected using Azure Arc-enabled servers. Some features and limitations unique to this scope include:

* [Patch orchestration](automatic-vm-guest-patching#patch-orchestration-modes) for virtual machines need to be set to AutomaticByPlatform
* A minimum of 1 hour and 10 minutes is required for the maintenance window.

![Screenshot of the upper maintenance window minimum time specification.](media/maintenance-configurations/add-schedule-maintenance-window.png)
* The upper maintenance window is 3 hours 55 mins.
* A minimum of 1 hour and 30 minutes is required for the maintenance window.
* There is no limit to the recurrence of your schedule.

## Shut Down Machines

We are unable to apply maintenance updates to any shut down machines. You need to ensure that your machine is turned on at least 15 minutes before a scheduled update or your update may not be applied. If your machine is in a shutdown state at the time of your scheduled update, it may appear that the maintenance configuration has been disassociated on the Azure portal, and this is only a display issue that the team is currently working to fix it. The maintenance configuration has not been completely disassociated and you can check it via CLI using [check configuration](maintenance-configurations-cli#check-configuration).

## Management options

You can create and manage maintenance configurations using any of the following options:

* [Azure CLI](maintenance-configurations-cli)
* [Azure PowerShell](maintenance-configurations-powershell)
* [Azure portal](maintenance-configurations-portal)

Important

Pre/Post **tasks** property is currently exposed in the API but it is not supported a this time.
