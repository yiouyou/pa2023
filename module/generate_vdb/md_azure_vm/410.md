## In this article

The first version of Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) relied on Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for authentication; the current version does not. We strongly encourage the use of the newest version.

## Determine ADE version

The versions of ADE in scope for migration are:

* **Windows**: 1.1.\* (ADE on the VM must be upgraded to 2.2)
* **Linux**: 0.1.\* (ADE on the VM must be upgraded to 1.2)

You can determine the version of ADE with which a VM was encrypted via Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure portal.

* [CLI](#tabpanel_1_CLI)
* [PowerShell](#tabpanel_1_PowerShell)
* [Portal](#tabpanel_1_Portal)

To determine the ADE version, run the Azure CLI [az vm get-instance-view](/en-us/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-get-instance-view) command.

```
az vm get-instance-view --resource-group  <ResourceGroupName> --name <VMName> 

```

Locate the AzureDiskEncryption extension in the output and identify the version number from the "TypeHandlerVersion" field in the output.

To determine the ADE version, run the Azure PowerShell [Get-AzVM](/en-us/powershell/module/az.compute/get-azvm) command.

```
Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupName> -Name <VMName> -Status

```

Locate the AzureDiskEncryption extension in the output and identify the version number from the "TypeHandlerVersion" field in the output.

Go to the "Extensions" blade of your VM in the Azure portal.

Choose the "AzureDiskEncryption" extension for Windows or "AzureDiskEncryptionForLinux" extension for Linux, and locate the version number in the "Version"" field.

## How to migrate

Migration from Azure Disk Encryption (with Azure AD) to Azure Disk Encryption (without Azure AD) is only available through Azure PowerShell. Ensure you have the latest version of Azure PowerShell and at least the [Azure PowerShell Az module version 5.9.0](/en-us/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az) installed .

To upgrade from Azure Disk Encryption (with Azure AD) to Azure Disk Encryption (without Azure AD), use the [Set-AzVMDiskEncryptionExtension](/en-us/powershell/module/az.compute/set-azvmdiskencryptionextension) PowerShell cmdlet.

Warning

The Set-AzVMDiskEncryptionExtension cmdlet must only be used on VMs encrypted with Azure Disk Encryption (with Azure AD). Attempting to migrate an unencrypted VM, or a VM encrypted with Azure Disk Encryption (without Azure AD), will result in a terminal error.

```
Set-AzVMDiskEncryptionExtension -ResourceGroupName <resourceGroupName> -VMName <vmName> -Migrate

```

When the cmdlet prompts you for confirmation, enter "Y". The ADE version will be updated and the VM rebooted. The output will look similar to the following:

```
Update AzureDiskEncryption version?
This cmdlet updates Azure Disk Encryption version to single pass (Azure Disk Encryption without Azure AD). This may reboot
the machine and takes 10-15 minutes to finish. Are you sure you want to continue?
[Y] Yes  [N] No  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"): Y

RequestId IsSuccessStatusCode StatusCode ReasonPhrase

                         True         OK OK

```

Important

The upgrade will take at least 10 - 15 minutes to complete. Do not cancel the cmdlet while the upgrade is in progress. Doing so puts the health of the VM at risk.
