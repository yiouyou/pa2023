The memory-optimized Ebsv5 and Ebdsv5 Azure virtual machine (VM) series deliver higher remote storage performance in each VM size than the [Ev4 series](ev4-esv4-series). The increased remote storage performance of the Ebsv5 and Ebdsv5 VMs is ideal for storage throughput-intensive workloads. For example, relational databases and data analytics applications.

The Ebsv5 and Ebdsv5 VMs offer up to 260000 IOPS and 8000 MBps of remote disk storage throughput. Both series also include up to 672 GiB of RAM. The Ebdsv5 series has local SSD storage up to 3800 GiB. Both series provide a 3X increase in remote storage performance of data-intensive workloads compared to prior VM generations. You can use these series to consolidate existing workloads on fewer VMs or smaller VM sizes while achieving potential cost savings. The Ebdsv5 series comes with a local disk and Ebsv5 is without a local disk. Standard SSDs and Standard HDD disk storage aren't supported in the Ebv5 series.

The Ebdsv5 and Ebsv5 series run on the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processors in a hyper-threaded configuration. The series are ideal for various memory-intensive enterprise applications. They feature:

* Up to 512 GiB of RAM
* [IntelÂ® Turbo Boost Technology 2.0](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html)
* [IntelÂ® Hyper-Threading Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html)
* [IntelÂ® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (IntelÂ® AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html)
* Support for [IntelÂ® Deep Learning Boost](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai/deep-learning-boost.html)
* NVMe interface for higher remote disk storage IOPS and throughput performance

Important

* Accelerated networking is required and turned on by default on all Ebsv5 and Ebdsv5 VMs.
* Ebsv5 and Ebdsv5-series VMs can [burst their disk performance](disk-bursting) and get up to their bursting max for up to 30 minutes at a time.
* The E112i size is offered as NVMe only to provide the highest IOPS and throughput performance. If you wish to achieve higher remote storage performance for small sizes, refer to the [instructions](enable-nvme-interface) on how to switch to the NVMe interface for sizes ranging from 2-96 vCPU. See the NVMe VM spec table to see the improved performance details.
* Please note that the NVMe capability is only available in the following regions: US North, Southeast Asia, West Europe, Australia East, North Europe, West US 3, UK South, Sweden Central, East US, Central US, West US2, East US 2, South Central US.

## Ebdsv5 series

Ebdsv5-series sizes run on the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processors. The Ebdsv5 VM sizes feature up to 672 GiB of RAM, in addition to fast and large local SSD storage (up to 3800 GiB). These VMs are ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications and applications that benefit from high remote storage performance, low latency, high-speed local storage. Remote Data disk storage is billed separately from VMs.

## Size table definitions

* Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
* Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
* Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **ReadOnly** or **ReadWrite**. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **None**.
* To learn how to get the best storage performance for your VMs, see [Virtual machine and disk performance](disks-performance).
* **Expected network bandwidth** is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, see [Virtual machine network bandwidth](../virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput).

Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, see [Optimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines](../virtual-network/virtual-network-optimize-network-bandwidth). To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, see [Bandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP)](../virtual-network/virtual-network-bandwidth-testing).
