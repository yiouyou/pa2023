The Av2-series VMs can be deployed on a variety of hardware types and processors. Av2-series run on the 3rd Generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake), the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake), the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® 8171M 2.1 GHz (Skylake), the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® E5-2673 v4 2.3 GHz (Broadwell), or the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® E5-2673 v3 2.4 GHz (Haswell) processors. Av2-series VMs have CPU performance and memory configurations best suited for entry level workloads like development and test. The size is throttled to offer consistent processor performance for the running instance, regardless of the hardware it is deployed on. To determine the physical hardware on which this size is deployed, query the virtual hardware from within the Virtual Machine. Some example use cases include development and test servers, low traffic web servers, small to medium databases, proof-of-concepts, and code repositories.

## Size table definitions

* Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
* Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
* Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **ReadOnly** or **ReadWrite**. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **None**.
* To learn how to get the best storage performance for your VMs, see [Virtual machine and disk performance](disks-performance).
* **Expected network bandwidth** is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, see [Virtual machine network bandwidth](../virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput).

Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, see [Optimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines](../virtual-network/virtual-network-optimize-network-bandwidth). To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, see [Bandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP)](../virtual-network/virtual-network-bandwidth-testing).
