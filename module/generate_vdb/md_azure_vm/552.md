## In this article

The first step in understanding compliance in Azure is to identify the status of your resources.
This quickstart steps you through the process of creating a policy assignment to identify virtual
machines that aren't using managed disks.

At the end of this process, you'll successfully identify virtual machines that aren't using managed
disks. They're *non-compliant* with the policy assignment.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) account
before you begin.

## Create a policy assignment

In this quickstart, you create a policy assignment and assign the *Audit VMs that do not use managed
disks* policy definition.

1. Launch the Azure Policy service in the Azure portal by selecting **All services**, then searching
for and selecting **Policy**.

2. Select **Assignments** on the left side of the Azure Policy page. An assignment is a policy that
has been assigned to take place within a specific scope.

3. Select **Assign Policy** from the top of the **Policy - Assignments** page.

4. On the **Assign Policy** page, set the **Scope** by selecting the ellipsis and then selecting
either a management group or subscription. Optionally, select a resource group. A scope
determines what resources or grouping of resources the policy assignment gets enforced on. Then
use the **Select** button at the bottom of the **Scope** page.

This example uses the **Contoso** subscription. Your subscription will differ.
5. Resources can be excluded based on the **Scope**. **Exclusions** start at one level lower than
the level of the **Scope**. **Exclusions** are optional, so leave it blank for now.
6. Select the **Policy definition** ellipsis to open the list of available definitions. Azure Policy
comes with built-in policy definitions you can use. Many are available, such as:

	* Enforce tag and its value
	* Apply tag and its value
	* Inherit a tag from the resource group if missingFor a partial list of available built-in policies, see [Azure Policy samples](samples/).
7. Search through the policy definitions list to find the *Audit VMs that do not use managed disks*
definition. Select that policy and then use the **Select** button.

8. The **Assignment name** is automatically populated with the policy name you selected, but you can
change it. For this example, leave *Audit VMs that do not use managed disks*. You can also add an
optional **Description**. The description provides details about this policy assignment.
**Assigned by** will automatically fill based on who is logged in. This field is optional, so
custom values can be entered.
9. Leave policy enforcement *Enabled*. For more information, see
[Policy assignment - enforcement mode](concepts/assignment-structure#enforcement-mode).
10. Select **Next** at the bottom of the page or the **Parameters** tab at the top of the page to
move to the next segment of the assignment wizard.
11. If the policy definition selected on the **Basics** tab included parameters, they are configured
on this tab. Since the *Audit VMs that do not use managed disks* has no parameters, select
**Next** at the bottom of the page or the **Remediation** tab at the top of the page to move to
the next segment of the assignment wizard.
12. Leave **Create a Managed Identity** unchecked. This box *must* be checked when the policy or
initiative includes a policy with either the
[deployIfNotExists](concepts/effects#deployifnotexists) or
[modify](concepts/effects#modify) effect. As the policy used for this quickstart doesn't,
leave it blank. For more information, see
[managed identities](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) and
[how remediation access control works](how-to/remediate-resources#how-remediation-access-control-works).
13. Select **Next** at the bottom of the page or the **Non-compliance messages** tab at the top of
the page to move to the next segment of the assignment wizard.
14. Set the **Non-compliance message** to *Virtual machines should use a managed disk*. This custom
message is displayed when a resource is denied or for non-compliant resources during regular
evaluation.
15. Select **Next** at the bottom of the page or the **Review + Create** tab at the top of the page
to move to the next segment of the assignment wizard.
16. Review the selected options, then select **Create** at the bottom of the page.

You're now ready to identify non-compliant resources to understand the compliance state of your
environment.

## Identify non-compliant resources

Select **Compliance** in the left side of the page. Then locate the *Audit VMs that do not use
managed disks* policy assignment you created.

![Screenshot of compliance details on the Policy Compliance page.](media/assign-policy-portal/policy-compliance.png)

If there are any existing resources that aren't compliant with this new assignment, they appear
under **Non-compliant resources**.

When a condition is evaluated against your existing resources and found true, then those resources
are marked as non-compliant with the policy. The following table shows how different policy effects
work with the condition evaluation for the resulting compliance state. Although you don't see the
evaluation logic in the Azure portal, the compliance state results are shown. The compliance state
result is either compliant or non-compliant.

| Resource State | Effect | Policy Evaluation | Compliance State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| New or Updated | Audit, Modify, AuditIfNotExist | True | Non-Compliant |
| New or Updated | Audit, Modify, AuditIfNotExist | False | Compliant |
| Exists | Deny, Audit, Append, Modify, DeployIfNotExist, AuditIfNotExist | True | Non-Compliant |
| Exists | Deny, Audit, Append, Modify, DeployIfNotExist, AuditIfNotExist | False | Compliant |

Note

The DeployIfNotExist and AuditIfNotExist effects require the IF statement to be TRUE and the
existence condition to be FALSE to be non-compliant. When TRUE, the IF condition triggers
evaluation of the existence condition for the related resources.

## Clean up resources

To remove the assignment created, follow these steps:

1. Select **Compliance** (or **Assignments**) in the left side of the Azure Policy page and locate
the *Audit VMs that do not use managed disks* policy assignment you created.
2. Right-click the *Audit VMs that do not use managed disks* policy assignment and select **Delete
assignment**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you assigned a policy definition to a scope and evaluated its compliance report.
The policy definition validates that all the resources in the scope are compliant and identifies
which ones aren't.
