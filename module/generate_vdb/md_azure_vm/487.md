This article describes how to expand managed disks for a Linux virtual machine (VM). You can [add data disks](add-disk) to provide for additional storage space, and you can also expand an existing data disk. The default virtual hard disk size for the operating system (OS) is typically 30 GB on a Linux VM in Azure. This article covers expanding either OS disks or data disks.

An OS disk has a maximum capacity of 4,095 GiB. However, many operating systems are partitioned with [master boot record (MBR)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record) by default. MBR limits the usable size to 2 TiB. If you need more than 2 TiB, create and attach data disks and use them for data storage. If you need to store data on the OS disk and require the additional space, convert it to GUID Partition Table (GPT).

Warning

Always make sure that your filesystem is in a healthy state, your disk partition table type (GPT or MBR) will support the new size, and ensure your data is backed up before you perform disk expansion operations. For more information, see the [Azure Backup quickstart](../../backup/quick-backup-vm-portal).

## Identify Azure data disk object within the operating system

In the case of expanding a data disk when there are several data disks present on the VM, it may be difficult to relate the Azure LUNs to the Linux devices. If the OS disk needs expansion, it will be clearly labeled in the Azure portal as the OS disk.

Start by identifying the relationship between disk utilization, mount point, and device, with the `df` command.

```
df -Th

```

```
Filesystem                Type      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1                 xfs        97G  1.8G   95G   2% /
<truncated>
/dev/sdd1                 ext4       32G   30G  727M  98% /opt/db/data
/dev/sde1                 ext4       32G   49M   30G   1% /opt/db/log

```

Here we can see, for example, the `/opt/db/data` filesystem is nearly full, and is located on the `/dev/sdd1` partition. The output of `df` will show the device path regardless of whether the disk is mounted by device path or the (preferred) UUID in the fstab. Also take note of the Type column, indicating the format of the filesystem. This will be important later.

Now locate the LUN which correlates to `/dev/sdd` by examining the contents of `/dev/disk/azure/scsi1`. The output of the following `ls` command will show that the device known as `/dev/sdd` within the Linux OS is located at LUN1 when looking in the Azure portal.

```
sudo ls -alF /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/

```

```

```

## Expand an Azure Managed Disk

### Expand without downtime

You can expand your managed disks without deallocating your VM. The host cache setting of your disk doesn't change whether or not you can expand a data disk without deallocating your VM.

This feature has the following limitations:

* Only supported for data disks.
* If a disk is 4 TiB or less, you should deallocate your VM and detach the disk before expanding it beyond 4 TiB. If a disk is already greater than 4 TiB, you can expand it without deallocating the VM and detaching the disk.
* Not supported for Ultra disks or Premium SSD v2 disks.
* Not supported for shared disks.
* Install and use either:
	+ The [latest Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
	+ The [latest Azure PowerShell module](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell)
	+ The [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
	+ Or an Azure Resource Manager template with an API version that's `2021-04-01` or newer.
* Not available on some classic VMs. Use [this script](#expanding-without-downtime-classic-vm-sku-support) to get a list of classic VM SKUs that support expanding without downtime.

### Expand Azure Managed Disk

Make sure that you have the latest [Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-az-cli2) installed and are signed in to an Azure account by using [az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login).

This article requires an existing VM in Azure with at least one data disk attached and prepared. If you don't already have a VM that you can use, see [Create and prepare a VM with data disks](tutorial-manage-disks#create-and-attach-disks).

In the following samples, replace example parameter names such as *myResourceGroup* and *myVM* with your own values.

Important

If your disk meets the requirements in [Expand without downtime](#expand-without-downtime), you can skip step 1 and 3.

1. Operations on virtual hard disks can't be performed with the VM running. Deallocate your VM with [az vm deallocate](/en-us/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-deallocate). The following example deallocates the VM named *myVM* in the resource group named *myResourceGroup*:

```
az vm deallocate --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM

```

Note

The VM must be deallocated to expand the virtual hard disk. Stopping the VM with `az vm stop` doesn't release the compute resources. To release compute resources, use `az vm deallocate`.
2. View a list of managed disks in a resource group with [az disk list](/en-us/cli/azure/disk#az-disk-list). The following example displays a list of managed disks in the resource group named *myResourceGroup*:

```
az disk list \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --query '[*].{Name:name,Gb:diskSizeGb,Tier:accountType}' \
    --output table

```

Expand the required disk with [az disk update](/en-us/cli/azure/disk#az-disk-update). The following example expands the managed disk named *myDataDisk* to *200* GB:

```
az disk update \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myDataDisk \
    --size-gb 200

```

Note

When you expand a managed disk, the updated size is rounded up to the nearest managed disk size. For a table of the available managed disk sizes and tiers, see [Azure Managed Disks Overview - Pricing and Billing](../managed-disks-overview).
3. Start your VM with [az vm start](/en-us/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-start). The following example starts the VM named *myVM* in the resource group named *myResourceGroup*:

```
az vm start --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM

```

## Expand a disk partition and filesystem

Note

While there are many tools that may be used for performing the partition resizing, the tools detailed in the remainder of this document are the same tools used by certain automated processes such as cloud-init. As described here, the `growpart` tool with the `gdisk` package provides universal compatibility with GUID Partition Table (GPT) disks, as older versions of some tools such as `fdisk` did not support GPT.

### Detecting a changed disk size

If a data disk was expanded without downtime using the procedure mentioned previously, the disk size won't be changed until the device is rescanned, which normally only happens during the boot process. This rescan can be called on-demand with the following procedure. In this example we have detected using the methods in this document that the data disk is currently `/dev/sda` and has been resized from 256GB to 512GB.

1. Identify the currently recognized size on the first line of output from `fdisk -l /dev/sda`

```
sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda

```

```
Disk /dev/sda: 256 GiB, 274877906944 bytes, 536870912 sectors
Disk model: Virtual Disk
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x43d10aad

Device     Boot Start       End   Sectors  Size Id Type
/dev/sda1        2048 536870878 536868831  256G 83 Linux

```
2. Insert a `1` character into the rescan file for this device. Note the reference to sda, this would change if a different disk device was resized.

```
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/block/sda/device/rescan

```
3. Verify that the new disk size has been recognized

```
sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda

```

```
Disk /dev/sda: 512 GiB, 549755813888 bytes, 1073741824 sectors
Disk model: Virtual Disk
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x43d10aad

Device     Boot Start       End   Sectors  Size Id Type
/dev/sda1        2048 536870878 536868831  256G 83 Linux

```

The remainder of this article uses the OS disk for the examples of the procedure for increasing the size of a volume at the OS level. If the expanded disk is a data disk, use the [previous guidance for identifying the data disk device](#identifyDisk), and follow these instructions as a guideline, substituting the data disk device (for example `/dev/sda`), partition numbers, volume names, mount points, and filesystem formats, as necessary.

All Linux OS guidance should be viewed as generic and may apply on any distribution, but generally matches the conventions of the named marketplace publisher. Reference the Red Hat documents for the package requirements on any distribution claiming Red Hat compatibility, such as CentOS and Oracle.

### Increase the size of the OS disk

The following instructions apply to endorsed Linux distributions.

Note

Before you proceed, make a full backup copy of your VM, or at a minimum take a snapshot of your OS disk.

* [Ubuntu](#tabpanel_1_ubuntu)
* [SUSE](#tabpanel_1_suse)
* [Red Hat/CentOS with LVM](#tabpanel_1_rhellvm)
* [Red Hat/CentOS without LVM](#tabpanel_1_rhelraw)

On Ubuntu 16.x and newer, the root partition of the OS disk and filesystems will be automatically expanded to utilize all free contiguous space on the root disk by cloud-init, provided there's a small bit of free space for the resize operation. For this circumstance the sequence is simply

1. Increase the size of the OS disk as detailed previously
2. Restart the VM, and then access the VM using the **root** user account.
3. Verify that the OS disk now displays an increased file system size.

As shown in the following example, the OS disk has been resized from the portal to 100 GB. The **/dev/sda1** file system mounted on **/** now displays 97 GB.

```
df -Th

```

```
Filesystem     Type      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
udev           devtmpfs  314M     0  314M   0% /dev
tmpfs          tmpfs      65M  2.3M   63M   4% /run
/dev/sda1      ext4       97G  1.8G   95G   2% /
tmpfs          tmpfs     324M     0  324M   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs          tmpfs     5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock
tmpfs          tmpfs     324M     0  324M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/sda15     vfat      105M  3.6M  101M   4% /boot/efi
/dev/sdb1      ext4       20G   44M   19G   1% /mnt
tmpfs          tmpfs      65M     0   65M   0% /run/user/1000
user@ubuntu:~#

```

To increase the OS disk size in SUSE 12 SP4, SUSE SLES 12 for SAP, SUSE SLES 15, and SUSE SLES 15 for SAP:

1. Follow the procedure above to expand the disk in the Azure infrastructure.
2. Access your VM as the **root** user by using the `sudo` command after logging in as another user:

```
sudo -i

```
3. Use the following command to install the **growpart** package, which will be used to resize the partition, if it isn't already present:

```
zypper install growpart

```
4. Use the `lsblk` command to find the partition mounted on the root of the file system (**/**). In this case, we see that partition 4 of device **sda** is mounted on **/**:

```
lsblk

```

```
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0   48G  0 disk
ââsda1   8:1    0    2M  0 part
ââsda2   8:2    0  512M  0 part /boot/efi
ââsda3   8:3    0    1G  0 part /boot
ââsda4   8:4    0 28.5G  0 part /
sdb      8:16   0    4G  0 disk
ââsdb1   8:17   0    4G  0 part /mnt/resource

```
5. Resize the required partition by using the `growpart` command and the partition number determined in the preceding step:

```
growpart /dev/sda 4

```

```
CHANGED: partition=4 start=3151872 old: size=59762655 end=62914527 new: size=97511391 end=100663263

```
6. Run the `lsblk` command again to check whether the partition has been increased.

The following output shows that the **/dev/sda4** partition has been resized to 46.5 GB:

```
lsblk

```

```
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0   48G  0 disk
ââsda1   8:1    0    2M  0 part
ââsda2   8:2    0  512M  0 part /boot/efi
ââsda3   8:3    0    1G  0 part /boot
ââsda4   8:4    0 46.5G  0 part /
sdb      8:16   0    4G  0 disk
ââsdb1   8:17   0    4G  0 part /mnt/resource

```
7. Identify the type of file system on the OS disk by using the `lsblk` command with the `-f` flag:

```
lsblk -f

```

```
NAME   FSTYPE LABEL UUID                                 MOUNTPOINT
sda
ââsda1
ââsda2 vfat   EFI   AC67-D22D                            /boot/efi
ââsda3 xfs    BOOT  5731a128-db36-4899-b3d2-eb5ae8126188 /boot
ââsda4 xfs    ROOT  70f83359-c7f2-4409-bba5-37b07534af96 /
sdb
ââsdb1 ext4         8c4ca904-cd93-4939-b240-fb45401e2ec6 /mnt/resource

```
8. Based on the file system type, use the appropriate commands to resize the file system.

For **xfs**, use this command:

```
xfs_growfs /

```

Example output:

```
meta-data=/dev/sda4              isize=512    agcount=4, agsize=1867583 blks
         =                       sectsz=512   attr=2, projid32bit=1
         =                       crc=1        finobt=0 spinodes=0 rmapbt=0
         =                       reflink=0
data     =                       bsize=4096   blocks=7470331, imaxpct=25
         =                       sunit=0      swidth=0 blks
naming   =version 2              bsize=4096   ascii-ci=0 ftype=1
log      =internal               bsize=4096   blocks=3647, version=2
         =                       sectsz=512   sunit=0 blks, lazy-count=1
realtime =none                   extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0
data blocks changed from 7470331 to 12188923

```

For **ext4**, use this command:

```
resize2fs /dev/sda4

```
9. Verify the increased file system size for **df -Th** by using this command:

```
df -Thl

```

Example output:

```
Filesystem     Type      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
devtmpfs       devtmpfs  445M  4.0K  445M   1% /dev
tmpfs          tmpfs     458M     0  458M   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs          tmpfs     458M   14M  445M   3% /run
tmpfs          tmpfs     458M     0  458M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/sda4      xfs        47G  2.2G   45G   5% /
/dev/sda3      xfs      1014M   86M  929M   9% /boot
/dev/sda2      vfat      512M  1.1M  511M   1% /boot/efi
/dev/sdb1      ext4      3.9G   16M  3.7G   1% /mnt/resource
tmpfs          tmpfs      92M     0   92M   0% /run/user/1000
tmpfs          tmpfs      92M     0   92M   0% /run/user/490

```

In the preceding example, we can see that the file system size for the OS disk has been increased.

1. Follow the procedure above to expand the disk in the Azure infrastructure.
2. Access your VM as the **root** user by using the `sudo` command after logging in as another user:

```
sudo -i

```
3. Use the `lsblk` command to determine which logical volume (LV) is mounted on the root of the file system (**/**). In this case, we see that **rootvg-rootlv** is mounted on **/**. If a different filesystem is in need of resizing, substitute the LV and mount point throughout this section.

```
lsblk -f

```

```

```
4. Check whether there's free space in the LVM volume group (VG) containing the root partition. If there's free space, skip to step 12.

```
vgdisplay rootvg

```

```
--- Volume group ---
VG Name               rootvg
System ID
Format                lvm2
Metadata Areas        1
Metadata Sequence No  7
VG Access             read/write
VG Status             resizable
MAX LV                0
Cur LV                6
Open LV               6
Max PV                0
Cur PV                1
Act PV                1
VG Size               <63.02 GiB
PE Size               4.00 MiB
Total PE              16132
Alloc PE / Size       6400 / 25.00 GiB
Free  PE / Size       9732 / <38.02 GiB
VG UUID               lPUfnV-3aYT-zDJJ-JaPX-L2d7-n8sL-A9AgJb

```

In this example, the line **Free PE / Size** shows that there's 38.02 GB free in the volume group, as the disk has already been resized.
5. Install the **cloud-utils-growpart** package to provide the **growpart** command, which is required to increase the size of the OS disk and the gdisk handler for GPT disk layouts This package is preinstalled on most marketplace images

```
yum install cloud-utils-growpart gdisk

```

In RHEL/CentOS 8.x VMs you can use `dnf` command instead of `yum`.
6. Determine which disk and partition holds the LVM physical volume (PV) or volumes in the volume group named **rootvg** by using the **pvscan** command. Note the size and free space listed between the brackets (**[** and **]**).

```
pvscan

```

```
PV /dev/sda4   VG rootvg          lvm2 [<63.02 GiB / <38.02 GiB free]

```
7. Verify the size of the partition by using `lsblk`.

```
lsblk /dev/sda4

```

```
NAME            MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda4              8:4    0  63G  0 part
âârootvg-tmplv  253:1    0   2G  0 lvm  /tmp
âârootvg-usrlv  253:2    0  10G  0 lvm  /usr
âârootvg-optlv  253:3    0   2G  0 lvm  /opt
âârootvg-homelv 253:4    0   1G  0 lvm  /home
âârootvg-varlv  253:5    0   8G  0 lvm  /var
âârootvg-rootlv 253:6    0   2G  0 lvm  /

```
8. Expand the partition containing this PV using *growpart*, the device name, and partition number. Doing so will expand the specified partition to use all the free contiguous space on the device.

```
growpart /dev/sda 4

```

```

```
9. Verify that the partition has resized to the expected size by using the `lsblk` command again. Notice that in the example **sda4** has changed from 63G to 95G.

```
lsblk /dev/sda4

```

```

```
10. Expand the PV to use the rest of the newly expanded partition

```
pvresize /dev/sda4

```

```
Physical volume "/dev/sda4" changed
1 physical volume(s) resized or updated / 0 physical volume(s) not resized

```
11. Verify the new size of the PV is the expected size, comparing to original **[size / free]** values.

```
pvscan

```

```
PV /dev/sda4   VG rootvg          lvm2 [<95.02 GiB / <70.02 GiB free]

```
12. Expand the LV by the required amount, which doesn't need to be all the free space in the volume group. In the following example, **/dev/mapper/rootvg-rootlv** is resized from 2 GB to 12 GB (an increase of 10 GB) through the following command. This command will also resize the file system on the LV.

```
lvresize -r -L +10G /dev/mapper/rootvg-rootlv

```

Example output:

```
Size of logical volume rootvg/rootlv changed from 2.00 GiB (512 extents) to 12.00 GiB (3072 extents).
Logical volume rootvg/rootlv successfully resized.

         =                       sectsz=4096  sunit=1 blks, lazy-count=1
realtime =none                   extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0
data blocks changed from 524288 to 3145728

```
13. The `lvresize` command automatically calls the appropriate resize command for the filesystem in the LV. Verify whether **/dev/mapper/rootvg-rootlv**, which is mounted on **/**, has an increased file system size by using the `df -Th` command:

Example output:

```
df -Th /

```

```
Filesystem                Type  Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/rootvg-rootlv xfs    12G   71M   12G   1% /

```

Note

To use the same procedure to resize any other logical volume, change the **lv** name in step **12**.

1. Follow the procedure above to expand the disk in the Azure infrastructure.
2. Access your VM as the **root** user by using the `sudo` command after logging in as another user:

```
sudo -i

```
3. When the VM has restarted, perform the following steps:

	1. Install the **cloud-utils-growpart** package to provide the **growpart** command, which is required to increase the size of the OS disk and the gdisk handler for GPT disk layouts. This package is preinstalled on most marketplace images
```
yum install cloud-utils-growpart gdisk

```

In RHEL/CentOS 8.x VMs you can use `dnf` command instead of `yum`.
4. Use the **lsblk -f** command to verify the partition and filesystem type holding the root (**/**) partition

```
lsblk -f

```

```
NAME    FSTYPE LABEL UUID                                 MOUNTPOINT

ââsda1  xfs          2a7bb59d-6a71-4841-a3c6-cba23413a5d2 /boot
ââsda2  xfs          148be922-e3ec-43b5-8705-69786b522b05 /
ââsda14
ââsda15 vfat         788D-DC65                            /boot/efi
sdb
ââsdb1  ext4         923f51ff-acbd-4b91-b01b-c56140920098 /mnt/resource

```
5. For verification, start by listing the partition table of the sda disk with **gdisk**. In this example, we see a 48.0 GiB disk with partition #2 sized 29.0 GiB. The disk was expanded from 30 GB to 48 GB in the Azure portal.

```
gdisk -l /dev/sda

```

```
GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 0.8.10

Partition table scan:

15           10240         1024000   495.0 MiB   EF00  EFI System Partition

```
6. Expand the partition for root, in this case sda2 by using the **growpart** command. Using this command expands the partition to use all of the contiguous space on the disk.

```
growpart /dev/sda 2

```

```
CHANGED: partition=2 start=2050048 old: size=60862464 end=62912512 new: size=98613214 end=100663262

```
7. Now print the new partition table with **gdisk** again. Notice that partition 2 has is now sized 47.0 GiB

```
gdisk -l /dev/sda

```

```

15           10240         1024000   495.0 MiB   EF00  EFI System Partition

```
8. Expand the filesystem on the partition with **xfs\_growfs**, which is appropriate for a standard marketplace-generated RedHat system:

```
xfs_growfs /

```

```
meta-data=/dev/sda2              isize=512    agcount=4, agsize=1901952 blks
         =                       sectsz=4096  attr=2, projid32bit=1
         =                       crc=1        finobt=0 spinodes=0
data     =                       bsize=4096   blocks=7607808, imaxpct=25
         =                       sunit=0      swidth=0 blks
naming   =version 2              bsize=4096   ascii-ci=0 ftype=1
log      =internal               bsize=4096   blocks=3714, version=2
         =                       sectsz=4096  sunit=1 blks, lazy-count=1
realtime =none                   extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0
data blocks changed from 7607808 to 12326651

```
9. Verify the new size is reflected with the **df** command

```
df -hl

```

```

```

## Expanding without downtime classic VM SKU support

If you're using a classic VM SKU, it might not support expanding disks without downtime.

Use the following PowerShell script to determine which VM SKUs it's available with:

```
Connect-AzAccount
$subscriptionId="yourSubID"
$location="desiredRegion"
Set-AzContext -Subscription $subscriptionId
$vmSizes=Get-AzComputeResourceSku -Location $location | where{$_.ResourceType -eq 'virtualMachines'}

foreach($vmSize in $vmSizes){
    foreach($capability in $vmSize.Capabilities)
    {
       if(($capability.Name -eq "EphemeralOSDiskSupported" -and $capability.Value -eq "True") -or ($capability.Name -eq "PremiumIO" -and $capability.Value -eq "True") -or ($capability.Name -eq "HyperVGenerations" -and $capability.Value -match "V2"))
        {
            $vmSize.Name
       }
   }
}

```
