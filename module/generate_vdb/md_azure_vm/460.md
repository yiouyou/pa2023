In this article, you learn how to download a Linux virtual hard disk (VHD) file from Azure using the Azure portal.

## Stop the VM

A VHD canât be downloaded from Azure if it's attached to a running VM. If you want to keep the VM running, you can [create a snapshot and then download the snapshot](#alternative-snapshot-the-vm-disk).

To stop the VM:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. On the left menu, select **Virtual Machines**.
3. Select the VM from the list.
4. On the page for the VM, select **Stop**.

### Alternative: Snapshot the VM disk

Take a snapshot of the disk to download.

1. Select the VM in the [portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Select **Disks** in the left menu and then select the disk you want to snapshot. The details of the disk will be displayed.
3. Select **Create Snapshot** from the menu at the top of the page. The **Create snapshot** page will open.
4. In **Name**, type a name for the snapshot.
5. For **Snapshot type**, select **Full** or **Incremental**.
6. When you are done, select **Review + create**.

Your snapshot will be created shortly, and can then be used to download or create another VM.

Note

If you don't stop the VM first, the snapshot will not be clean. The snapshot will be in the same state as if the VM had been power cycled or crashed at the point in time when the snapshot was made. While usually safe, it could cause problems if the running applications running at the time were not crash resistant.

This method is only recommended for VMs with a single OS disk. VMs with one or more data disks should be stopped before download or before creating a snapshot for the OS disk and each data disk.

## Secure downloads and uploads with Azure AD

If you're using [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](../../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) to control resource access, you can now use it to restrict uploads and downloads of Azure managed disks. This feature is available as a GA offering in all regions. When a user attempts to upload or download a disk, Azure validates the identity of the requesting user in Azure AD, and confirms that user has the required permissions. At a higher level, a system administrator could set a policy at the Azure account or subscription level, to ensure that all disks and snapshots must use Azure AD for uploads or downloads. If you have any questions on securing uploads or downloads with Azure AD, reach out to this email: azuredisks@microsoft .com

### Restrictions

* VHDs can't be uploaded to empty snapshots.
* Azure Backup doesn't currently support disks secured with Azure AD.

### Prerequisites

* Install the latest [Azure PowerShell module](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell).

### Assign RBAC role

To access managed disks secured with Azure AD, the requesting user must have either the [Data Operator for Managed Disks](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#data-operator-for-managed-disks) role, or a [custom role](../../role-based-access-control/custom-roles-portal) with the following permissions:

* **Microsoft.Compute/disks/download/action**
* **Microsoft.Compute/disks/upload/action**
* **Microsoft.Compute/snapshots/download/action**
* **Microsoft.Compute/snapshots/upload/action**

For detailed steps on assigning a role, see the following articles for [portal](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal), [PowerShell](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-powershell), or [CLI](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-cli). To create or update a custom role, see the following articles for [portal](../../role-based-access-control/custom-roles-portal), [PowerShell](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-powershell), or [CLI](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-cli).

### Enable data access authentication mode

* [Portal](#tabpanel_1_azure-portal)
* [PowerShell](#tabpanel_1_azure-powershell)
* [Azure CLI](#tabpanel_1_azure-cli)

Enable **data access authentication mode** to restrict access to the disk. You can either enable it when creating the disk, or you can enable it on the **Disk Export** page for existing disks.

[![Screenshot of a disk's data access authentication mode checkbox, tick the checkbox to restrict access to the disk, and save your changes.](../../includes/media/disks-upload-download-portal/disks-data-access-auth-mode.png)](../../includes/media/disks-upload-download-portal/disks-data-access-auth-mode.png#lightbox)

Set `dataAccessAuthMode` to `"AzureActiveDirectory"` on your disk, in order to download it when it's been secured. Use the following script to update an existing disk, replace the values for `-ResourceGroupName` and `-DiskName` before running the script:

```
New-AzDiskUpdateConfig -DataAccessAuthMode "AzureActiveDirectory" | Update-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName 'yourResourceGroupName' -DiskName 'yourDiskName"

```

Set `dataAccessAuthMode` to `"AzureActiveDirectory"` on your disk, in order to download it when it's been secured. Use the following script to update an existing disk, replace the values for `--resource-group` and `--Name` before running the script:

```
az disk update --name yourDiskName --resource-group yourResourceGroup --data-access-auth-mode AzureActiveDirectory

```

## Generate SAS URL

To download the VHD file, you need to generate a [shared access signature (SAS)](../../storage/common/storage-sas-overview?toc=/azure/virtual-machines/windows/toc.json) URL. When the URL is generated, an expiration time is assigned to the URL.

* [Portal](#tabpanel_1_azure-portal)
* [PowerShell](#tabpanel_1_azure-powershell)
* [Azure CLI](#tabpanel_1_azure-cli)

1. On the menu of the page for the VM, select **Disks**.
2. Select the operating system disk for the VM, and then select **Disk Export**.
3. If required, update the value of **URL expires in (seconds)** to give you enough time to complete the download. The default is 3600 seconds (one hour).
4. Select **Generate URL**.

```
$diskSas = Grant-AzDiskAccess -ResourceGroupName "yourRGName" -DiskName "yourDiskName" -DurationInSecond 86400 -Access 'Read'

```

```
az disk grant-access --duration-in-seconds 86400 --access-level Read --name yourDiskName --resource-group yourRGName

```

## Download VHD

Note

If you're using Azure AD to secure managed disk downloads, the user downloading the VHD must have the appropriate [RBAC permissions](#assign-rbac-role).

* [Portal](#tabpanel_2_azure-portal)
* [PowerShell](#tabpanel_2_azure-powershell)
* [Azure CLI](#tabpanel_2_azure-cli)

1. Under the URL that was generated, select **Download the VHD file**.

![Shows the button to download the VHD.](media/download-vhd/export-download.png)
2. You may need to select **Save** in the browser to start the download. The default name for the VHD file is *abcd*.

Use the following script to download your VHD:

```
Connect-AzAccount
#Set localFolder to your desired download location
$localFolder = "yourPathHere"
$blob = Get-AzStorageBlobContent -Uri $diskSas.AccessSAS -Destination $localFolder -Force 

```

When the download finishes, revoke access to your disk using `Revoke-AzDiskAccess -ResourceGroupName "yourRGName" -DiskName "yourDiskName"`.

Replace `yourPathhere` and `sas-URI` with your values, then use the following script to download your VHD:

Note

If you're using Azure AD to secure your managed disk uploads and downloads, add `--auth-mode login` to `az storage blob download`.

```

#set localFolder to your desired download location
localFolder=yourPathHere
#If you're using Azure AD to secure your managed disk uploads and downloads, add --auth-mode login to the following command.
az storage blob download -f $localFolder --blob-url "sas-URI"

```

When the download finishes, revoke access to your disk using `az disk revoke-access --name diskName --resource-group yourRGName`.
