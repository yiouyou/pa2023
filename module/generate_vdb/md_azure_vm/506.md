## In this article

You can filter network traffic inbound to and outbound from a virtual network subnet with a network security group. Network security groups contain security rules that filter network traffic by IP address, port, and protocol. Security rules are applied to resources deployed in a subnet. In this article, you learn how to:

* Create a network security group and security rules
* Create a virtual network and associate a network security group to a subnet
* Deploy virtual machines (VM) into a subnet
* Test traffic filters

## Azure Cloud Shell

Azure hosts Azure Cloud Shell, an interactive shell environment that you can use through your browser. You can use either Bash or PowerShell with Cloud Shell to work with Azure services. You can use the Cloud Shell preinstalled commands to run the code in this article, without having to install anything on your local environment.

To start Azure Cloud Shell:

| Option | Example/Link |
| --- | --- |
| Select **Try It** in the upper-right corner of a code or command block. Selecting **Try It** doesn't automatically copy the code or command to Cloud Shell. | Screenshot that shows an example of Try It for Azure Cloud Shell. |
| Go to <https://shell.azure.com>, or select the **Launch Cloud Shell** button to open Cloud Shell in your browser. | [Screenshot that shows how to launch Cloud Shell in a new window.](https://shell.azure.com) |
| Select the **Cloud Shell** button on the menu bar at the upper right in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). | Screenshot that shows the Cloud Shell button in the Azure portal |

To use Azure Cloud Shell:

1. Start Cloud Shell.
2. Select the **Copy** button on a code block (or command block) to copy the code or command.
3. Paste the code or command into the Cloud Shell session by selecting **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**V** on Windows and Linux, or by selecting **Cmd**+**Shift**+**V** on macOS.
4. Select **Enter** to run the code or command.

If you choose to install and use PowerShell locally, this article requires the Azure PowerShell module version 1.0.0 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az` to find the installed version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

## Create a network security group

A network security group contains security rules. Security rules specify a source and destination. Sources and destinations can be application security groups.

### Create application security groups

First create a resource group for all the resources created in this article with [New-AzResourceGroup](/en-us/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azresourcegroup). The following example creates a resource group in the *eastus* location:

```
New-AzResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Location EastUS

```

Create an application security group with [New-AzApplicationSecurityGroup](/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/new-azapplicationsecuritygroup). An application security group enables you to group servers with similar port filtering requirements. The following example creates two application security groups.

```
$webAsg = New-AzApplicationSecurityGroup `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -Name myAsgWebServers `
  -Location eastus

$mgmtAsg = New-AzApplicationSecurityGroup `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -Name myAsgMgmtServers `
  -Location eastus

```

### Create security rules

Create a security rule with [New-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig](/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworksecurityruleconfig). The following example creates a rule that allows traffic inbound from the internet to the *myWebServers* application security group over ports 80 and 443:

```
$webRule = New-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig `
  -Name "Allow-Web-All" `
  -Access Allow `
  -Protocol Tcp `
  -Direction Inbound `
  -Priority 100 `
  -SourceAddressPrefix Internet `
  -SourcePortRange * `
  -DestinationApplicationSecurityGroupId $webAsg.id `
  -DestinationPortRange 80,443

The following example creates a rule that allows traffic inbound from the internet to the *myMgmtServers* application security group over port 3389:

$mgmtRule = New-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig `
  -Name "Allow-RDP-All" `
  -Access Allow `
  -Protocol Tcp `
  -Direction Inbound `
  -Priority 110 `
  -SourceAddressPrefix Internet `
  -SourcePortRange * `
  -DestinationApplicationSecurityGroupId $mgmtAsg.id `
  -DestinationPortRange 3389

```

In this article, RDP (port 3389) is exposed to the internet for the *myAsgMgmtServers* VM. For production environments, instead of exposing port 3389 to the internet, it's recommended that you connect to Azure resources that you want to manage using a [VPN](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways?toc=/azure/virtual-network/toc.json) or [private](../expressroute/expressroute-introduction?toc=/azure/virtual-network/toc.json) network connection.

### Create a network security group

Create a network security group with [New-AzNetworkSecurityGroup](/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworksecuritygroup). The following example creates a network security group named *myNsg*:

```
$nsg = New-AzNetworkSecurityGroup `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -Location eastus `
  -Name myNsg `
  -SecurityRules $webRule,$mgmtRule

```

## Create a virtual network

Create a virtual network with [New-AzVirtualNetwork](/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/new-azvirtualnetwork). The following example creates a virtual named *myVirtualNetwork*:

```
$virtualNetwork = New-AzVirtualNetwork `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -Location EastUS `
  -Name myVirtualNetwork `
  -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/16

```

Create a subnet configuration with [New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig](/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/new-azvirtualnetworksubnetconfig), and then write the subnet configuration to the virtual network with [Set-AzVirtualNetwork](/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/set-azvirtualnetwork). The following example adds a subnet named *mySubnet* to the virtual network and associates the *myNsg* network security group to it:

```
Add-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig `
  -Name mySubnet `
  -VirtualNetwork $virtualNetwork `
  -AddressPrefix "10.0.2.0/24" `
  -NetworkSecurityGroup $nsg
$virtualNetwork | Set-AzVirtualNetwork

```

## Create virtual machines

Before creating the VMs, retrieve the virtual network object with the subnet with [Get-AzVirtualNetwork](/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/get-azvirtualnetwork):

```
$virtualNetwork = Get-AzVirtualNetwork `
 -Name myVirtualNetwork `
 -Resourcegroupname myResourceGroup

```

Create a public IP address for each VM with [New-AzPublicIpAddress](/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/new-azpublicipaddress):

```
$publicIpWeb = New-AzPublicIpAddress `
  -AllocationMethod Dynamic `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -Location eastus `
  -Name myVmWeb

$publicIpMgmt = New-AzPublicIpAddress `
  -AllocationMethod Dynamic `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -Location eastus `
  -Name myVmMgmt

```

Create two network interfaces with [New-AzNetworkInterface](/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworkinterface), and assign a public IP address to the network interface. The following example creates a network interface, associates the *myVmWeb* public IP address to it, and makes it a member of the *myAsgWebServers* application security group:

```
$webNic = New-AzNetworkInterface `
  -Location eastus `
  -Name myVmWeb `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -SubnetId $virtualNetwork.Subnets[0].Id `
  -ApplicationSecurityGroupId $webAsg.Id `
  -PublicIpAddressId $publicIpWeb.Id

```

The following example creates a network interface, associates the *myVmMgmt* public IP address to it, and makes it a member of the *myAsgMgmtServers* application security group:

```
$mgmtNic = New-AzNetworkInterface `
  -Location eastus `
  -Name myVmMgmt `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -SubnetId $virtualNetwork.Subnets[0].Id `
  -ApplicationSecurityGroupId $mgmtAsg.Id `
  -PublicIpAddressId $publicIpMgmt.Id

```

Create two VMs in the virtual network so you can validate traffic filtering in a later step.

Create a VM configuration with [New-AzVMConfig](/en-us/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvmconfig), then create the VM with [New-AzVM](/en-us/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvm). The following example creates a VM that will serve as a web server. The `-AsJob` option creates the VM in the background, so you can continue to the next step:

```
# Create user object
$cred = Get-Credential -Message "Enter a username and password for the virtual machine."

$webVmConfig = New-AzVMConfig `
  -VMName myVmWeb `
  -VMSize Standard_DS1_V2 | `
Set-AzVMOperatingSystem -Windows `
  -ComputerName myVmWeb `
  -Credential $cred | `
Set-AzVMSourceImage `
  -PublisherName MicrosoftWindowsServer `
  -Offer WindowsServer `
  -Skus 2016-Datacenter `
  -Version latest | `
Add-AzVMNetworkInterface `
  -Id $webNic.Id
New-AzVM `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -Location eastus `
  -VM $webVmConfig `
  -AsJob

```

Create a VM to serve as a management server:

```
# Create user object
$cred = Get-Credential -Message "Enter a username and password for the virtual machine."

# Create the web server virtual machine configuration and virtual machine.
$mgmtVmConfig = New-AzVMConfig `
  -VMName myVmMgmt `
  -VMSize Standard_DS1_V2 | `
Set-AzVMOperatingSystem -Windows `
  -ComputerName myVmMgmt `
  -Credential $cred | `
Set-AzVMSourceImage `
  -PublisherName MicrosoftWindowsServer `
  -Offer WindowsServer `
  -Skus 2016-Datacenter `
  -Version latest | `
Add-AzVMNetworkInterface `
  -Id $mgmtNic.Id
New-AzVM `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  -Location eastus `
  -VM $mgmtVmConfig

```

The virtual machine takes a few minutes to create. Don't continue with the next step until Azure finishes creating the VM.

## Test traffic filters

Use [Get-AzPublicIpAddress](/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/get-azpublicipaddress) to return the public IP address of a VM. The following example returns the public IP address of the *myVmMgmt* VM:

```
Get-AzPublicIpAddress `
  -Name myVmMgmt `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  | Select IpAddress

```

Use the following command to create a remote desktop session with the *myVmMgmt* VM from your local computer. Replace `<publicIpAddress>` with the IP address returned from the previous command.

```
mstsc /v:<publicIpAddress>

```

Open the downloaded RDP file. If prompted, select **Connect**.

Enter the user name and password you specified when creating the VM (you may need to select **More choices**, then **Use a different account**, to specify the credentials you entered when you created the VM), then select **OK**. You may receive a certificate warning during the sign-in process. Select **Yes** to proceed with the connection.

The connection succeeds, because port 3389 is allowed inbound from the internet to the *myAsgMgmtServers* application security group that the network interface attached to the *myVmMgmt* VM is in.

Use the following command to create a remote desktop connection to the *myVmWeb* VM, from the *myVmMgmt* VM, with the following command, from PowerShell:

```
mstsc /v:myvmWeb

```

The connection succeeds because a default security rule within each network security group allows traffic over all ports between all IP addresses within a virtual network. You can't create a remote desktop connection to the *myVmWeb* VM from the internet because the security rule for the *myAsgWebServers* doesn't allow port 3389 inbound from the internet.

Use the following command to install Microsoft IIS on the *myVmWeb* VM from PowerShell:

```
Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools

```

After the IIS installation is complete, disconnect from the *myVmWeb* VM, which leaves you in the *myVmMgmt* VM remote desktop connection. To view the IIS welcome screen, open an internet browser and browse to http://myVmWeb.

Disconnect from the *myVmMgmt* VM.

On your computer, enter the following command from PowerShell to retrieve the public IP address of the *myVmWeb* server:

```
Get-AzPublicIpAddress `
  -Name myVmWeb `
  -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
  | Select IpAddress

```

To confirm that you can access the *myVmWeb* web server from outside of Azure, open an internet browser on your computer and browse to `http://<public-ip-address-from-previous-step>`. The connection succeeds, because port 80 is allowed inbound from the internet to the *myAsgWebServers* application security group that the network interface attached to the *myVmWeb* VM is in.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use [Remove-AzResourceGroup](/en-us/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azresourcegroup) to remove the resource group and all of the resources it contains:

```
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup -Force

```

## Next steps

In this article, you created a network security group and associated it to a virtual network subnet. To learn more about network security groups, see [Network security group overview](network-security-groups-overview) and [Manage a network security group](manage-network-security-group).

Azure routes traffic between subnets by default. You may instead, choose to route traffic between subnets through a VM, serving as a firewall, for example. To learn how, see [Create a route table](tutorial-create-route-table-powershell).
