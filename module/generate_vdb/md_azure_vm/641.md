## In this article

You can use the [Azure Backup service](backup-overview) to back up on-premises machines and workloads, along with Azure virtual machines (VMs). This article summarizes support settings and limitations when you back up Azure VMs by using Azure Backup.

Other support matrices include:

* [General support matrix](backup-support-matrix) for Azure Backup
* [Support matrix](backup-support-matrix-mabs-dpm) for Azure Backup servers and System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM) backup
* [Support matrix](backup-support-matrix-mars-agent) for backup with the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent

## Supported scenarios

Here's how you can back up and restore Azure VMs by using the Azure Backup service.

| **Scenario** | **Backup** | **Agent** | **Restore** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Direct backup of Azure VMs | Back up the entire VM. | No additional agent is needed on the Azure VM. Azure Backup installs and uses an extension to the [Azure VM agent](../virtual-machines/extensions/agent-windows) that's running on the VM. | Restore as follows: - **Create a basic VM**. This is useful if the VM has no special configuration, such as multiple IP addresses. - **Restore the VM disk**. Restore the disk. Then attach it to an existing VM, or create a new VM from the disk by using PowerShell. - **Replace the VM disk**. If a VM exists and it uses managed disks (unencrypted), you can restore a disk and use it to replace an existing disk on the VM. - **Restore specific files or folders**. You can restore files or folders from a VM instead of restoring the entire VM. |
| Direct backup of Azure VMs (Windows only) | Back up specific files, folders, or volumes. | Install the [Azure Recovery Services agent](backup-azure-file-folder-backup-faq). You can run the MARS agent alongside the backup extension for the Azure VM agent to back up the VM at the file or folder level. | Restore specific files or folders. |
| Backup of Azure VMs to the backup server | Back up files, folders, or volumes; system state or bare metal files; and app data to System Center DPM or to Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS). DPM or MABS then backs up to the backup vault. | Install the DPM or MABS protection agent on the VM. The MARS agent is installed on DPM or MABS. | Restore files, folders, or volumes; system state or bare metal files; and app data. |

## Supported backup actions

| **Action** | **Support** |
| --- | --- |
| Back up a VM that's shut down or offline | Supported. Snapshot is crash consistent only, not app consistent. |
| Back up disks after migrating to managed disks | Supported. Backup will continue to work. No action is required. |
| Back up managed disks after enabling a resource group lock | Not supported. Azure Backup can't delete the older restore points. Backups will start to fail when the limit of restore points is reached. |
| Modify backup policy for a VM | Supported. The VM will be backed up according to the schedule and retention settings in the new policy. If retention settings are extended, existing recovery points are marked and kept. If they're reduced, existing recovery points will be pruned in the next cleanup job and eventually deleted. |
| Cancel a backup job | Supported during the snapshot process. Not supported when the snapshot is being transferred to the vault. |
| Back up the VM to a different region or subscription | Not supported.For successful backup, virtual machines must be in the same subscription as the vault for backup. |
| Back up daily via the Azure VM extension | Four backups per day: one scheduled backup as set up in the backup policy, and three on-demand backups.  To allow user retries in case of failed attempts, the hard limit for on-demand backups is set to nine attempts. |
| Back up daily via the MARS agent | Three scheduled backups per day. |
| Back up daily via DPM or MABS | Two scheduled backups per day. |
| Back up monthly or yearly | Not supported when you're backing up with the Azure VM extension. Only daily and weekly are supported. |
| Automatically adjust the clock | Not supported. |
| [Disable security features for hybrid backup](backup-azure-security-feature) | Not supported. |
| Back up a VM whose machine time is changed | Not supported. If you change the machine time to a future date/time after enabling backup for that VM, even if the time change is reverted, successful backup isn't guaranteed. |
| Do multiple backups per day | Supported through **Enhanced policy**.  For hourly backup, the minimum recovery point objective (RPO) is 4 hours and the maximum is 24 hours. You can set the backup schedule to 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours, respectively.  Note that the maximum limit of instant recovery point retention range depends on the number of snapshots you take per day. If the snapshot count is more (for example, every *4 hours* frequency in *24 hours* duration - *6* scheduled snapshots), then the maximum allowed days for retention reduces. However, if you choose lower RPO of *12* hours, the snapshot retention is increased to *30 days*.  Learn about how to [back up an Azure VM using Enhanced policy](backup-azure-vms-enhanced-policy). |
| Back up a VM with a deprecated plan when the publisher has removed it from Azure Marketplace | Not supported.  Backup is possible. However, restore will fail.  If you've already configured backup for a VM with a deprecated virtual machine offer and encounter a restore error, see [Troubleshoot backup errors with Azure VMs](backup-azure-vms-troubleshoot#usererrormarketplacevmnotsupported---vm-creation-failed-due-to-market-place-purchase-request-being-not-present). |

## Operating system support (Windows)

The following table summarizes the supported operating systems when you're backing up Azure VMs running Windows.

| **Scenario** | **OS support** |
| --- | --- |
| Back up with the Azure VM agent extension | - Windows 11 client (64 bit only)  |
| Back up with the MARS agent | [Supported](backup-support-matrix-mars-agent#supported-operating-systems) operating systems |
| Back up with DPM or MABS | Supported operating systems for backup with [MABS](backup-mabs-protection-matrix) and [DPM](/en-us/system-center/dpm/dpm-protection-matrix) |

Azure Backup doesn't support 32-bit operating systems.

## Support for Linux backup

Here's what's supported if you want to back up Linux machines.

| **Action** | **Support** |
| --- | --- |
| Back up Linux Azure VMs with the Linux Azure VM agent | Supported for file-consistent backup. Also supported for app-consistent backup that uses [custom scripts](backup-azure-linux-app-consistent). During restore, you can create a new VM, restore a disk and use it to create a VM, or restore a disk and use it to replace a disk on an existing VM. You can also restore individual files and folders. |
| Back up Linux Azure VMs with the MARS agent | Not supported. The MARS agent can be installed only on Windows machines. |
| Back up Linux Azure VMs with DPM or MABS | Not supported. |
| Back up Linux Azure VMs with Docker mount points | Currently, Azure Backup doesn't support exclusion of Docker mount points because these are mounted at different paths every time. |

## Operating system support (Linux)

For Linux VM backups, Azure Backup supports the list of [Linux distributions endorsed by Azure](../virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros). Note the following:

* Azure Backup doesn't support CoreOS Linux.
* Azure Backup doesn't support 32-bit operating systems.
* Other bring-your-own Linux distributions might work as long as the [Azure VM agent for Linux](../virtual-machines/extensions/agent-linux) is available on the VM, and as long as Python is supported.
* Azure Backup doesn't support a proxy-configured Linux VM if it doesn't have Python version 2.7 or later installed.
* Azure Backup doesn't support backing up Network File System (NFS) files that are mounted from storage, or from any other NFS server, to Linux or Windows machines. It backs up only disks that are locally attached to the VM.

## Support matrix for managed pre and post scripts for Linux databases

Azure Backup provides the following support for customers to author their own pre and post scripts.

| Supported database | OS version | Database version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Oracle in Azure VMs | [Oracle Linux](../virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros) | Oracle 12.x or later |

## Backup frequency and retention

| **Setting** | **Limits** |
| --- | --- |
| Maximum recovery points per protected instance (machine or workload) | 9999. |
| Maximum expiry time for a recovery point | No limit (99 years). |
| Maximum backup frequency to a vault (Azure VM extension) | Once a day. |
| Maximum backup frequency to a vault (MARS agent) | Three backups per day. |
| Maximum backup frequency to DPM or MABS | Every 15 minutes for SQL Server. Once an hour for other workloads. |
| Recovery point retention | Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. |
| Maximum retention period | Depends on backup frequency. |
| Recovery points on DPM or MABS disk | 64 for file servers, and 448 for app servers. Tape recovery points are unlimited for on-premises DPM. |

## Supported restore methods

| **Restore option** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Create a new VM** | This option quickly creates and gets a basic VM up and running from a restore point. You can specify a name for the VM, select the resource group and virtual network in which it will be placed, and specify a storage account for the restored VM. The new VM must be created in the same region as the source VM. |
| **Restore disk** | This option restores a VM disk, which can you can then use to create a new VM. Azure Backup provides a template to help you customize and create a VM.  The restore job generates a template that you can download and use to specify custom VM settings and create a VM. |
| **Replace existing** | You can restore a disk and use it to replace a disk on the existing VM. The current VM must exist. If it has been deleted, you can't use this option. Azure Backup takes a snapshot of the existing VM before replacing the disk, and it stores the snapshot in the staging location that you specify. Existing disks connected to the VM are replaced with the selected restore point. The snapshot is copied to the vault and retained in accordance with the retention policy.  After the replace disk operation, the original disk is retained in the resource group. You can choose to manually delete the original disks if they aren't needed. This option is supported for unencrypted managed VMs and for VMs [created from custom images](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/videos/create-a-custom-virtual-machine-image-in-azure-resource-manager-with-powershell/). It's not supported for unmanaged disks and VMs, classic VMs, and [generalized VMs](../virtual-machines/windows/capture-image-resource). If the restore point has more or fewer disks than the current VM, the number of disks in the restore point will only reflect the VM configuration. This option is also supported for VMs with linked resources, like [user-assigned managed identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) and [Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/general/overview). |
| **Cross Region (secondary region)** | You can use cross-region restore to restore Azure VMs in the secondary region, which is an [Azure paired region](../availability-zones/cross-region-replication-azure). You can restore all the Azure VMs for the selected recovery point if the backup is done in the secondary region. This feature is available for the following options: - [Create a VM](backup-azure-arm-restore-vms#create-a-vm)  - [Restore disks](backup-azure-arm-restore-vms#restore-disks)  We don't currently support the [Replace existing disks](backup-azure-arm-restore-vms#replace-existing-disks) option. Backup admins and app admins have permissions to perform the restore operation on a secondary region. |
| **Cross Subscription (preview)** | You can use cross-subscription restore to restore Azure managed VMs in different subscriptions. You can restore Azure VMs or disks to any subscription (within the same tenant as the source subscription) from restore points. This is one of the Azure role-based access control (RBAC) capabilities.  This feature is available for the following options: - [Create a VM](backup-azure-arm-restore-vms#create-a-vm)  - [Restore disks](backup-azure-arm-restore-vms#restore-disks)  Cross-subscription restore is unsupported for [snapshots](backup-azure-vms-introduction#snapshot-creation) and [secondary region](backup-azure-arm-restore-vms#restore-in-secondary-region) restores. It's also unsupported for [unmanaged VMs](backup-azure-arm-restore-vms#restoring-unmanaged-vms-and-disks-as-managed), [encrypted Azure VMs](backup-azure-vms-introduction#encryption-of-azure-vm-backups), and [trusted launch VMs](backup-support-matrix-iaas#tvm-backup). |
| **Cross Zonal Restore** | You can use cross-zonal restore to restore Azure zone-pinned VMs in available zones. You can restore Azure VMs or disks to different zones (one of the Azure RBAC capabilities) from restore points.  This feature is available for the following options: - [Create a VM](backup-azure-arm-restore-vms#create-a-vm)  - [Restore disks](backup-azure-arm-restore-vms#restore-disks)  Cross-zonal restore is unsupported for [snapshots](backup-azure-vms-introduction#snapshot-creation) of restore points. It's also unsupported for [encrypted Azure VMs](backup-azure-vms-introduction#encryption-of-azure-vm-backups) and [trusted launch VMs](backup-support-matrix-iaas#tvm-backup). |

## Support for file-level restore

| **Restore** | **Supported** |
| --- | --- |
| Restore files across operating systems | You can restore files on any machine that has the same OS as the backed-up VM, or a compatible OS. See the [compatible OS table](backup-azure-restore-files-from-vm#step-3-os-requirements-to-successfully-run-the-script). |
| Restore files from encrypted VMs | Not supported. |
| Restore files from network-restricted storage accounts | Not supported. |
| Restore files on VMs by using Windows Storage Spaces | Not supported. |
| Restore files on a Linux VM by using LVM or RAID arrays | Not supported on the same VM. |

| [Restore spot VMs](../virtual-machines/spot-vms) | Not supported.  |
| [Restore VMs in an Azure dedicated host](../virtual-machines/dedicated-hosts) | Supported.When you're restoring an Azure VM through the [Create new](backup-azure-arm-restore-vms#create-a-vm) option, the VM can't be restored in the dedicated host, even when the restore is successful. To achieve this, we recommend that you [restore as disks](backup-azure-arm-restore-vms#restore-disks). While you're restoring as disks by using the template, create a VM in a dedicated host, and then attach the disks.This is not applicable in a secondary region while you're performing [cross-region restore](backup-azure-arm-restore-vms#cross-region-restore). |
| Configure standalone Azure VMs in Windows Storage Spaces | Not supported. |
| [Restore Virtual Machine Scale Sets](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-orchestration-modes#scale-sets-with-flexible-orchestration) | Supported for the flexible orchestration model to back up and restore a single Azure VM. |

| Managed disks | Supported. |
| Encrypted disks | Supported. |
| Disks with a write accelerator enabled | Azure VMs with disk backup for a write accelerator became available in all Azure public regions on May 18, 2022. If disk backup for a write accelerator is not required as part of VM backup, you can choose to remove it by using the [selective disk feature](selective-disk-backup-restore). **Important**  Virtual machines with write accelerator disks need internet connectivity for a successful backup, even though those disks are excluded from the backup. |
| Disks enabled for access with a private endpoint | Not supported. |
| Backup and restore of deduplicated VMs or disks | Azure Backup doesn't support deduplication. For more information, see [this article](backup-support-matrix#disk-deduplication-support).  |
| Adding a disk to a protected VM | Supported. |
| Resizing a disk on a protected VM | Supported. |
| Shared storage | Backing up VMs by using Cluster Shared Volumes (CSV) or Scale-Out File Server isn't supported. CSV writers are likely to fail during backup. On restore, disks that contain CSV volumes might not come up. |
| [Shared disks](../virtual-machines/disks-shared-enable) | Not supported. |
| Ultra SSD disks | Supported with [Enhanced policy](backup-azure-vms-enhanced-policy). The support is currently in preview.  Supported region(s) - Sweden Central, South Central US, East US, East US 2, West US 2, West Europe and North Europe.

## Support for VM security and encryption

Azure Backup supports encryption for in-transit and at-rest data.

For network traffic to Azure:

* The Backup traffic from servers to the Recovery Services vault is encrypted via Advanced Encryption Standard 256.
* Backup data is sent over a secure HTTPS link.
* Backup data is stored in the Recovery Services vault in encrypted form.
* Only you have the encryption key to unlock this data. Microsoft can't decrypt the backup data at any point.

Warning

After you set up the vault, only you have access to the encryption key. Microsoft never maintains a copy and doesn't have access to the key. If the key is misplaced, Microsoft can't recover the backup data.

For data security:

* When you're backing up Azure VMs, you need to set up encryption *within* the virtual machine.
* Azure Backup supports Azure Disk Encryption, which uses BitLocker on virtual machines running Windows and uses *dm-crypt* on Linux virtual machines.
* On the back end, Azure Backup uses [Azure Storage service-side encryption](../storage/common/storage-service-encryption) to help protect data at rest.

| **Machine** | **In transit** | **At rest** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| On-premises Windows machines without DPM or MABS | Yes | Yes |
| Azure VMs | Yes | Yes |
| On-premises or Azure VMs with DPM | Yes | Yes |
| On-premises or Azure VMs with MABS | Yes | Yes |

## VM compression support

Azure Backup supports the compression of backup traffic. Note the following:

* For Azure VMs, the VM extension reads the data directly from the Azure storage account over the storage network. It isn't necessary to compress this traffic.
* If you're using DPM or MABS, you can save bandwidth by compressing the data before it's backed up.

| **Machine** | **Compress to DPM/MABS (TCP)** | **Compress to vault (HTTPS)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| On-premises Windows machines without DPM or MABS | Not applicable | Yes |
| Azure VMs | Not applicable | Not applicable |
| On-premises or Azure VMs with DPM | Yes | Yes |
| On-premises or Azure VMs with MABS | Yes | Yes |

## Next steps

* [Back up Azure VMs](backup-azure-arm-vms-prepare).
* [Back up Windows machines directly](tutorial-backup-windows-server-to-azure), without a backup server.
* [Set up MABS](backup-azure-microsoft-azure-backup) for backup to Azure, and then back up workloads to MABS.
* [Set up DPM](backup-azure-dpm-introduction) for backup to Azure, and then back up workloads to DPM.
