**Applies to:** âï¸ Linux VMs âï¸ Flexible scale sets

This article walks you through how to deploy [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch), [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash), and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana), on an Ubuntu VM in Azure. To see the Elastic Stack in action, you can optionally connect to Kibana and work with some sample logging data.

Additionally, you can follow the [Deploy Elastic on Azure Virtual Machines](/en-us/training/modules/deploy-elastic-azure-virtual-machines/) module for a more guided tutorial on deploying Elastic on Azure Virtual Machines.

In this tutorial you learn how to:

* Create an Ubuntu VM in an Azure resource group
* Install Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana on the VM
* Send sample data to Elasticsearch with Logstash
* Open ports and work with data in the Kibana console

This deployment is suitable for basic development with the Elastic Stack. For more on the Elastic Stack, including recommendations for a production environment, see the [Elastic documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html) and the [Azure Architecture Center](/en-us/azure/architecture/elasticsearch/).

## Prerequisites

* Use the Bash environment in [Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see [Quickstart for Bash in Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).

[![](../../reusable-content/azure-cli/media/hdi-launch-cloud-shell.png)](https://shell.azure.com)
* If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally, [install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see [How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).

	+ If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the [az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see [Sign in with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).
	+ When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see [Use extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).
	+ Run [az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version) to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run [az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).

* This article requires version 2.0.4 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Create a resource group

Create a resource group with the [az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group) command. An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location.

```
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus

```

## Create a virtual machine

Create a VM with the [az vm create](/en-us/cli/azure/vm) command.

The following example creates a VM named *myVM* and creates SSH keys if they do not already exist in a default key location. To use a specific set of keys, use the `--ssh-key-value` option.

```
az vm create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myVM \
    --image UbuntuLTS \
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --generate-ssh-keys

```

When the VM has been created, the Azure CLI shows information similar to the following example. Take note of the `publicIpAddress`. This address is used to access the VM.

```
{
  "fqdns": "",
  "id": "/subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM",
  "location": "eastus",
  "macAddress": "00-0D-3A-23-9A-49",
  "powerState": "VM running",
  "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.4",
  "publicIpAddress": "40.68.254.142",
  "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup"
}

```

## SSH into your VM

If you don't already know the public IP address of your VM, run the [az network public-ip list](/en-us/cli/azure/network/public-ip) command:

```
az network public-ip list --resource-group myResourceGroup --query [].ipAddress

```

Use the following command to create an SSH session with the virtual machine. Substitute the correct public IP address of your virtual machine. In this example, the IP address is *40.68.254.142*.

```
ssh azureuser@40.68.254.142

```

## Install the Elastic Stack

Import the Elasticsearch signing key and update your APT sources list to include the Elastic package repository:

```
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/5.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-5.x.list

```

Install the Java Virtual on the VM and configure the JAVA\_HOME variable-this is necessary for the Elastic Stack components to run.

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre-headless
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64

```

Run the following commands to update Ubuntu package sources and install Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Logstash.

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install elasticsearch kibana logstash   

```

Note

Detailed installation instructions, including directory layouts and initial configuration, are maintained in [Elastic's documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack/current/installing-elastic-stack.html)

## Start Elasticsearch

Start Elasticsearch on your VM with the following command:

```
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service

```

This command produces no output, so verify that Elasticsearch is running on the VM with this `curl` command:

```
sudo curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/'

```

If Elasticsearch is running, you see output like the following:

```
{
  "name" : "w6Z4NwR",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "SDzCajBoSK2EkXmHvJVaDQ",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "5.6.3",
    "build_hash" : "1a2f265",
    "build_date" : "2017-10-06T20:33:39.012Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "6.6.1"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}

```

## Start Logstash and add data to Elasticsearch

Start Logstash with the following command:

```
sudo systemctl start logstash.service

```

Test Logstash in interactive mode to make sure it's working correctly:

```
sudo /usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash -e 'input { stdin { } } output { stdout {} }'

```

This is a basic Logstash [pipeline](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/5.6/pipeline.html) that echoes standard input to standard output.

```
The stdin plugin is now waiting for input:
hello azure
2017-10-11T20:01:08.904Z myVM hello azure

```

Set up Logstash to forward the kernel messages from this VM to Elasticsearch. Create a new file in an empty directory called `vm-syslog-logstash.conf` and paste in the following Logstash configuration:

```
input {
    stdin {
        type => "stdin-type"
    }

    file {
        type => "syslog"
        path => [ "/var/log/*.log", "/var/log/*/*.log", "/var/log/messages", "/var/log/syslog" ]
        start_position => "beginning"
    }
}

output {

    stdout {
        codec => rubydebug
    }
    elasticsearch {
        hosts  => "localhost:9200"
    }
}

```

Test this configuration and send the syslog data to Elasticsearch:

```
sudo /usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash -f vm-syslog-logstash.conf

```

You see the syslog entries in your terminal echoed as they are sent to Elasticsearch. Use `CTRL+C` to exit out of Logstash once you've sent some data.

## Start Kibana and visualize the data in Elasticsearch

Edit `/etc/kibana/kibana.yml` and change the IP address Kibana listens on so you can access it from your web browser.

```
server.host: "0.0.0.0"

```

Start Kibana with the following command:

```
sudo systemctl start kibana.service

```

Open port 5601 from the Azure CLI to allow remote access to the Kibana console:

```
az vm open-port --port 5601 --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM

```

Open up the Kibana console and select **Create** to generate a default index based on the syslog data you sent to Elasticsearch earlier.

![Screenshot that shows the Kibana console and highlights the Create button.](media/elasticsearch-install/kibana-index.png)

Select **Discover** on the Kibana console to search, browse, and filter through the syslog events.
