## In this article

The first step in understanding compliance in Azure is to identify the status of your resources. In
this quickstart, you create a policy assignment to identify virtual machines that aren't using
managed disks. When complete, you'll identify virtual machines that are *non-compliant*.

The Python library is used to manage Azure resources from the command line or in scripts. This guide
explains how to use Python library to create a policy assignment.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) account
before you begin.

## Azure Cloud Shell

Azure hosts Azure Cloud Shell, an interactive shell environment that you can use through your browser. You can use either Bash or PowerShell with Cloud Shell to work with Azure services. You can use the Cloud Shell preinstalled commands to run the code in this article, without having to install anything on your local environment.

To start Azure Cloud Shell:

| Option | Example/Link |
| --- | --- |
| Select **Try It** in the upper-right corner of a code or command block. Selecting **Try It** doesn't automatically copy the code or command to Cloud Shell. | Screenshot that shows an example of Try It for Azure Cloud Shell. |
| Go to <https://shell.azure.com>, or select the **Launch Cloud Shell** button to open Cloud Shell in your browser. | [Screenshot that shows how to launch Cloud Shell in a new window.](https://shell.azure.com) |
| Select the **Cloud Shell** button on the menu bar at the upper right in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). | Screenshot that shows the Cloud Shell button in the Azure portal |

To use Azure Cloud Shell:

1. Start Cloud Shell.
2. Select the **Copy** button on a code block (or command block) to copy the code or command.
3. Paste the code or command into the Cloud Shell session by selecting **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**V** on Windows and Linux, or by selecting **Cmd**+**Shift**+**V** on macOS.
4. Select **Enter** to run the code or command.

## Add the Policy library

To enable Python to work with Azure Policy, the library must be added. This library works wherever
Python can be used, including [bash on Windows 10](/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) or locally installed.

1. Check that the latest Python is installed (at least **3.8**). If it isn't yet installed, download
it at [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Check that the latest Azure CLI is installed (at least **2.5.1**). If it isn't yet installed, see
[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Note

Azure CLI is required to enable Python to use the **CLI-based authentication** in the following
examples. For information about other options, see
[Authenticate using the Azure management libraries for Python](/en-us/azure/developer/python/sdk/authentication-overview).
3. Authenticate through Azure CLI.

```
az login

```
4. In your Python environment of choice, install the required libraries for Azure Policy:

```
# Add the Python library for Python
pip install azure-mgmt-policyinsights

# Add the Resources library for Python
pip install azure-mgmt-resource

# Add the CLI Core library for Python for authentication (development only!)
pip install azure-cli-core

# Add the Azure identity library for Python
pip install azure.identity

```

Note

If Python is installed for all users, these commands must be run from an elevated console.
5. Validate that the libraries have been installed. `azure-mgmt-policyinsights` should be **0.5.0**
or higher, `azure-mgmt-resource` should be **9.0.0** or higher, and `azure-cli-core` should be
**2.5.0** or higher.

```
# Check each installed library
pip show azure-mgmt-policyinsights azure-mgmt-resource azure-cli-core azure.identity

```

## Create a policy assignment

In this quickstart, you create a policy assignment and assign the **Audit VMs that do not use
managed disks** (`06a78e20-9358-41c9-923c-fb736d382a4d`) definition. This policy definition
identifies resources that aren't compliant to the conditions set in the policy definition.

Run the following code to create a new policy assignment:

```
# Import specific methods and models from other libraries
from azure.mgmt.resource.policy import PolicyClient
from azure.mgmt.resource.policy.models import PolicyAssignment, Identity, UserAssignedIdentitiesValue, PolicyAssignmentUpdate
from azure.identity import AzureCliCredential

# Set subscription
subId = "{subId}"
assignmentLocation = "westus2"

# Get your credentials from Azure CLI (development only!) and get your subscription list
credential = AzureCliCredential()
policyClient = PolicyClient(credential, subId, base_url=none)

# Create details for the assignment
policyAssignmentIdentity = Identity(type="SystemAssigned")
policyAssignmentDetails = PolicyAssignment(display_name="Audit VMs without managed disks Assignment", policy_definition_id="/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/06a78e20-9358-41c9-923c-fb736d382a4d", description="Shows all virtual machines not using managed disks", identity=policyAssignmentIdentity, location=assignmentLocation)

# Create new policy assignment
policyAssignment = policyClient.policy_assignments.create("{scope}", "audit-vm-manageddisks", policyAssignmentDetails)

# Show results
print(policyAssignment)

```

The preceding commands use the following information:

Assignment details:

* **subId** - Your subscription. Needed for authentication. Replace `{subId}` with your
subscription.
* **display\_name** - Display name for the policy assignment. In this case, you're using *Audit VMs
without managed disks Assignment*.
* **policy\_definition\_id** - The policy definition path, based on which you're using to create the
assignment. In this case, it's the ID of policy definition *Audit VMs that do not use managed
disks*. In this example, the policy definition is a built-in and the path doesn't include
management group or subscription information.
* **scope** - A scope determines what resources or grouping of resources the policy assignment gets
enforced on. It could range from a management group to an individual resource. Be sure to replace
`{scope}` with one of the following patterns:
	+ Management group: `/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{managementGroup}`
	+ Subscription: `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}`
	+ Resource group: `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}`
	+ Resource: `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/{resourceProviderNamespace}/[{parentResourcePath}/]`
* **description** - A deeper explanation of what the policy does or why it's assigned to this scope.

Assignment creation:

* Scope - This scope determines where the policy assignment gets saved. The scope set in the
assignment details must exist within this scope.
* Name - The actual name of the assignment. For this example, *audit-vm-manageddisks* was used.
* Policy assignment - The Python **PolicyAssignment** object created in the previous step.

You're now ready to identify non-compliant resources to understand the compliance state of your
environment.

## Identify non-compliant resources

Use the following information to identify resources that aren't compliant with the policy assignment
you created. Run the following code:

```
# Import specific methods and models from other libraries
from azure.mgmt.policyinsights._policy_insights_client import PolicyInsightsClient
from azure.mgmt.policyinsights.models import QueryOptions
from azure.identity import AzureCliCredential

# Set subscription
subId = "{subId}"

# Get your credentials from Azure CLI (development only!) and get your subscription list
credential = AzureCliCredential()
policyClient = PolicyInsightsClient(credential, subId, base_url=none)

# Set the query options
queryOptions = QueryOptions(filter="IsCompliant eq false and PolicyAssignmentId eq 'audit-vm-manageddisks'",apply="groupby((ResourceId))")

# Fetch 'latest' results for the subscription
results = policyInsightsClient.policy_states.list_query_results_for_subscription(policy_states_resource="latest", subscription_id=subId, query_options=queryOptions)

# Show results
print(results)

```

Replace `{subId}` with the subscription you want to see the compliance results for this policy
assignment. For a list of other scopes and ways to summarize the data, see
[Policy State methods](/en-us/python/api/azure-mgmt-policyinsights/azure.mgmt.policyinsights.operations.policystatesoperations#methods).

Your results resemble the following example:

```
{
    'additional_properties': {
        '@odata.nextLink': None
    },
    'odatacontext': 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.PolicyInsights/policyStates/$metadata#latest',
    'odatacount': 12,
    'value': [{data}]
}

```

The results match what you see in the **Resource compliance** tab of a policy assignment in the
Azure portal view.

## Clean up resources

To remove the assignment created, use the following command:

```
# Import specific methods and models from other libraries
from azure.mgmt.resource.policy import PolicyClient
from azure.identity import AzureCliCredential

# Set subscription
subId = "{subId}"

# Get your credentials from Azure CLI (development only!) and get your subscription list
credential = AzureCliCredential()
policyClient = PolicyClient(credential, subId, base_url=none)

# Delete the policy assignment
policyAssignment = policyClient.policy_assignments.delete("{scope}", "audit-vm-manageddisks")

# Show results
print(policyAssignment)

```

Replace `{subId}` with your subscription and `{scope}` with the same scope you used to create the
policy assignment.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you assigned a policy definition to identify non-compliant resources in your
Azure environment.
