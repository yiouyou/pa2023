## In this article

An Azure Virtual Machine (VM) has one or more network interfaces (NIC) attached to it. Any NIC can have one or more static or dynamic public and private IP addresses assigned to it.

Assigning multiple IP addresses to a VM enables the following capabilities:

* Hosting multiple websites or services with different IP addresses and TLS/SSL certificates on a single server.
* Serve as a network virtual appliance, such as a firewall or load balancer.
* The ability to add any of the private IP addresses for any of the NICs to an Azure Load Balancer back-end pool. In the past, only the primary IP address for the primary NIC could be added to a back-end pool. For more information about load balancing multiple IP configurations, see [Load balancing multiple IP configurations](../../load-balancer/load-balancer-multiple-ip?toc=/azure/virtual-network/toc.json).

Every NIC attached to a VM has one or more IP configurations associated to it. Each configuration is assigned one static or dynamic private IP address. Each configuration may also have one public IP address resource associated to it. To learn more about IP addresses in Azure, see [IP addresses in Azure](public-ip-addresses).

Note

All IP configurations on a single NIC must be associated to the same subnet. If multiple IPs on different subnets are desired, multiple NICs on a VM can be used. To learn more about multiple NICs on a VM in Azure, see [Create VM with Multiple NICs](../../virtual-machines/windows/multiple-nics).

There's a limit to how many private IP addresses can be assigned to a NIC. There's also a limit to how many public IP addresses that can be used in an Azure subscription. See the [Azure limits](../../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits?toc=/azure/virtual-network/toc.json#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits) article for details.

This article explains how to add multiple IP addresses to a virtual machine using PowerShell.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* PowerShell environment in [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/powershell) or Azure PowerShell installed locally. To learn more about using PowerShell in Azure Cloud Shell, see [Azure Cloud Shell Quickstart](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart?tabs=powershell).

	+ If you choose to install and use PowerShell locally, this article requires the Azure PowerShell module version 5.4.1 or later. Run `Get-InstalledModule -Name Az` to find the installed version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell). Ensure your Az.Network module is 4.3.0 or later. To verify the installed module, use the command `Get-InstalledModule -Name "Az.Network"`. If the module requires an update, use the command `Update-Module -Name "Az.Network"` if necessary.
* Sign in to Azure PowerShell and ensure you've selected the subscription with which you want to use this feature. For more information, see [Sign in with Azure PowerShell](/en-us/powershell/azure/authenticate-azureps).

Note

Though the steps in this article assigns all IP configurations to a single NIC, you can also assign multiple IP configurations to any NIC in a multi-NIC VM. To learn how to create a VM with multiple NICs, see [Create a VM with multiple NICs](../../virtual-machines/windows/multiple-nics).

## Create a resource group

An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

Create a resource group with [New-AzResourceGroup](/en-us/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azresourcegroup) named **myResourceGroup** in the **eastus2** location.

```
$rg =@{
    Name = 'myResourceGroup'
    Location = 'eastus2'
}
New-AzResourceGroup @rg

```

## Create a virtual network

In this section, you create a virtual network for the virtual machine.

Use [New-AzVirtualNetwork](/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/new-azvirtualnetwork) and [New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig](/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/new-azvirtualnetworksubnetconfig) to create a virtual network with one subnet.

```
## Create backend subnet config ##
$subnet = @{
    Name = 'myBackendSubnet'
    AddressPrefix = '10.1.0.0/24'
}
$subnetConfig = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig @subnet

## Create the virtual network ##
$vnet = @{
    Name = 'myVNet'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
    Location = 'eastus2'
    AddressPrefix = '10.1.0.0/16'
    Subnet = $subnetConfig
}
New-AzVirtualNetwork @vnet

```

## Create a primary public IP address

Use [New-AzPublicIpAddress](/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/new-azpublicipaddress) to create a primary public IP address.

```
$ip1 = @{
    Name = 'myPublicIP-1'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
    Location = 'eastus2'
    Sku = 'Standard'
    AllocationMethod = 'Static'
    IpAddressVersion = 'IPv4'
    Zone = 1,2,3
}
New-AzPublicIpAddress @ip1

```

## Create a network security group

In this section, you create a network security group for the virtual machine and virtual network. You create a rule to allow connections to the virtual machine on port 22 for SSH.

Use [New-AzNetworkSecurityGroup](/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworksecuritygroup) and [New-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig](/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworksecurityruleconfig) to create the network security group and rules.

```
## Create rule for network security group and place in variable. ##
$nsgrule1 = @{
    Name = 'myNSGRuleSSH'
    Description = 'Allow SSH'
    Protocol = '*'
    SourcePortRange = '*'
    DestinationPortRange = '22'
    SourceAddressPrefix = 'Internet'
    DestinationAddressPrefix = '*'
    Access = 'Allow'
    Priority = '200'
    Direction = 'Inbound'
}
$rule1 = New-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig @nsgrule1

## Create network security group ##
$nsg = @{
    Name = 'myNSG'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
    Location = 'eastus2'
    SecurityRules = $rule1
}
New-AzNetworkSecurityGroup @nsg

```

## Create a network interface

Use [New-AzNetworkInterface](/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworkinterface) and [New-AzNetworkInterfaceIpConfig](/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworkinterfaceipconfig) to create a network interface (NIC) for the virtual machine. The public IP address and network security group created previously are associated with the network interface. The network interface is attached to the virtual network you created previously.

```
## Place the virtual network into a variable. ##
$net = @{
    Name = 'myVNet'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork @net

## Place the network security group into a variable. ##
$ns = @{
    Name = 'myNSG'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$nsg = Get-AzNetworkSecurityGroup @ns

## Place the primary public IP address into a variable. ##
$pub1 = @{
    Name = 'myPublicIP-1'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$pubIP1 = Get-AzPublicIPAddress @pub1

## Create a primary IP configuration for the network interface. ##
$IP1 = @{
    Name = 'ipconfig1'
    Subnet = $vnet.Subnets[0]
    PrivateIpAddressVersion = 'IPv4'
    PublicIPAddress = $pubIP1
}
$IP1Config = New-AzNetworkInterfaceIpConfig @IP1 -Primary

## Create a secondary IP configuration for the network interface. ##
$IP3 = @{
    Name = 'ipconfig3'
    Subnet = $vnet.Subnets[0]
    PrivateIpAddressVersion = 'IPv4'
    PrivateIpAddress = '10.1.0.6'
}
$IP3Config = New-AzNetworkInterfaceIpConfig @IP3

## Command to create a network interface. ##
$nic = @{
    Name = 'myNIC1'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
    Location = 'eastus2'
    NetworkSecurityGroup = $nsg
    IpConfiguration = $IP1Config,$IP3Config
}
New-AzNetworkInterface @nic

```

Note

When adding a static IP address, you must specify an unused, valid address on the subnet the NIC is connected to.

## Create a virtual machine

Use the following commands to create the virtual machine:

* [New-AzVM](/en-us/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvm)
* [New-AzVMConfig](/en-us/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvmconfig)
* [Set-AzVMOperatingSystem](/en-us/powershell/module/az.compute/set-azvmoperatingsystem)
* [Set-AzVMSourceImage](/en-us/powershell/module/az.compute/set-azvmsourceimage)
* [Add-AzVMNetworkInterface](/en-us/powershell/module/az.compute/add-azvmnetworkinterface)

```
$cred = Get-Credential

## Place network interface into a variable. ##
$nic = @{
    Name = 'myNIC1'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$nicVM = Get-AzNetworkInterface @nic

## Create a virtual machine configuration for VMs ##
$vmsz = @{
    VMName = 'myVM'
    VMSize = 'Standard_DS1_v2'
}
$vmos = @{
    ComputerName = 'myVM'
    Credential = $cred
}
$vmimage = @{
    PublisherName = 'Debian'
    Offer = 'debian-11'

    Location = 'eastus2'
    VM = $vmConfig
    SshKeyName = 'mySSHKey'
    }
New-AzVM @vm -GenerateSshKey

```

## Add secondary private and public IP address

Use [New-AzPublicIpAddress](/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/new-azpublicipaddress) to create a secondary public IP address.

```
$ip2 = @{
    Name = 'myPublicIP-2'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
    Location = 'eastus2'
    Sku = 'Standard'
    AllocationMethod = 'Static'
    IpAddressVersion = 'IPv4'
    Zone = 1,2,3
}
New-AzPublicIpAddress @ip2

```

Use [New-AzNetworkInterfaceIpConfig](/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworkinterfaceipconfig) to create the secondary IP configuration for the virtual machine.

```
## Place the virtual network into a variable. ##
$net = @{
    Name = 'myVNet'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork @net

## Place your virtual network subnet into a variable. ##
$sub = @{
    Name = 'myBackendSubnet'
    VirtualNetwork = $vnet
}
$subnet = Get-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig @sub

## Place the secondary public IP address you created previously into a variable. ##
$pip = @{
    Name = 'myPublicIP-2'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$pubIP2 = Get-AzPublicIPAddress @pip

## Place the network interface into a variable. ##
$net = @{
    Name = 'myNIC1'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$nic = Get-AzNetworkInterface @net

## Create a secondary IP configuration for the network interface. ##
$IPc2 = @{
    Name = 'ipconfig2'
    Subnet = $vnet.Subnets[0]
    PrivateIpAddressVersion = 'IPv4'
    PrivateIpAddress = '10.1.0.5'
    PublicIPAddress = $pubIP2
}
$IP2Config = New-AzNetworkInterfaceIpConfig @IPc2

## Add the IP configuration to the network interface. ##
$nic.IpConfigurations.Add($IP2Config)

## Save the configuration to the network interface. ##
$nic | Set-AzNetworkInterface

```

## Add IP addresses to a VM operating system

Connect and sign in to a VM you created with multiple private IP addresses. You must manually add all the private IP addresses, including the primary, that you added to the VM. Complete the following steps for your VM operating system.

### Windows Server

Expand
1. Open a command prompt or PowerShell.
2. Enter **`ipconfig /all`** at the command line. You'll see the **Primary** private IP address that was assigned through DHCP.
3. Enter **`ncpa.cpl`** at the command line to open the **Network Connections** configuration.
4. Open the **Properties** for the network adapter assigned the new IP addresses.
5. Double-click **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**.
6. Select **Use the following IP address:**. Enter the following values.

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **IP address:** | Enter the **Primary** private IP address. |
| **Subnet mask:** | Enter a subnet mask based on your IP address.  For example, if the subnet is a **/24** subnet then the subnet mask is **255.255.255.0**. |
| **Default gateway:** | The first IP address in the subnet.  If your subnet is **10.0.0.0/24**, then the gateway IP address is **10.0.0.1**. |
7. Select **Use the following DNS server addresses:**. Enter the following values.

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Preferred DNS server:** | Enter your primary DNS server.  Enter the IP address of **168.63.129.16** to use the default Azure provided DNS. |
8. Select the **Advanced** button.
9. Select **Add**.
10. Enter the private **IP address** you added to the Azure network interface. Enter the corresponding **Subnet mask**. Select **Add**.
11. Repeat the previous steps to add any additional private IP addresses that you added to the Azure network interface.

Important

You should never manually assign the public IP address assigned to an Azure virtual machine within the virtual machine's operating system. When you manually set the IP address within the operating system, ensure that it's the same address as the private IP address assigned to the Azure network interface. Failure to assign the address correctly can cause loss of connectivity to the virtual machine. For more information, see [Change IP address settings](virtual-network-network-interface-addresses#change-ip-address-settings).

For more information about private IP addresses, see [Private IP address](virtual-network-network-interface-addresses#private).

12. Select **OK** to close the secondary IP address settings.
13. Select **OK** to close the adapter settings. Your RDP connection will re-establish.
14. Open a command prompt or PowerShell.
15. Enter **`ipconfig /all`** at the command line.
16. Verify the primary and secondary private IP addresses have been added to the configuration.

```

```
17. Ensure the primary private IP address used in windows is the same as the primary IP address of the Azure VM network interface. For more information, see [No Internet access from Azure Windows VM that has multiple IP addresses](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4040882/no-internet-access-from-azure-windows-vm-that-has-multiple-ip-addresse).

#### Validation (Windows Server)

To validate connectivity to the internet from the secondary IP configuration via the public IP, use the following command. Replace 10.1.0.5 with the secondary private IP address you added to the Azure VM network interface.

```
ping -S 10.1.0.5 outlook.com

```

Note

For secondary IP configurations, you can ping to the Internet if the configuration has a public IP address associated with it. For primary IP configurations, a public IP address is not required to ping to the Internet.

### SUSE Linux Enterprise and openSUSE

Expand

SUSE-based distributions use the `cloud-netconfig` plugin from the `cloud-netconfig-azure` package to manage additional IP addresses. No manual configuration is required on the part of the administrator. The first IP address of an interface set on the platform is assigned via DHCP. The cloud-netconfig plugin then probes the Azure Instance Metadata Service API continuously (once per minute) for additional IP addresses assigned to the interface and adds/removes them as secondary IP addresses automatically.
This plugin should be installed and enabled on new images by default. Configuration steps for old workloads can be found here: <https://www.suse.com/c/multi-nic-cloud-netconfig-ec2-azure/>.

### Ubuntu 14/16

Expand
We recommend looking at the latest documentation for your Linux distribution.

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Ensure you're the root user. If you aren't, enter the following command:

```
sudo -i

```
3. Update the configuration file of the network interface (assuming **âeth0â**).

	* Keep the existing line item for dhcp. The primary IP address remains configured as it was previously.
	* Add a configuration for an additional static IP address with the following commands:

	```
	cd /etc/network/interfaces.d/
	ls

	```

	You should see a .cfg file.
4. Open the file. You should see the following lines at the end of the file:

```
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

```
5. Add the following lines after the lines that exist in the file. Replace **`10.1.0.5`** with your private IP address and subnet mask.

```
iface eth0 inet static
address 10.1.0.5
netmask 255.255.255.0

```

To add additional private IP addresses, edit the file and add the new private IP addresses on subsequent lines:

```
iface eth0 inet static
address 10.1.0.5
netmask 255.255.255.0
iface eth0 inet static
address 10.1.0.6
netmask 255.255.255.0

```
6. Save the file by using the following command:

```
:wq

```
7. Reset the network interface with the following command:

```
ifdown eth0 && ifup eth0

```

Important

Execute both ifdown and ifup in the same line if using a remote connection.
8. Verify the IP address is added to the network interface with the following command:

```
ip addr list eth0

```

You should see the IP address you added as part of the list. Example:

```
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
link/ether 00:0d:3a:04:45:16 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
inet 10.1.0.5/24 brd 10.1.0.255 scope global eth0
   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
inet 10.1.0.6/24 brd 10.1.0.255 scope global secondary eth0
   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
inet 10.1.0.4/24 brd 10.1.0.255 scope global secondary eth0
   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
inet6 fe80::20d:3aff:fe04:4516/64 scope link
   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

```

#### Validation (Ubuntu 14/16)

To ensure you're able to connect to the internet from your secondary IP configuration via the public IP associated with it, use the following command:

```
ping -I 10.1.0.5 outlook.com

```

Note

For secondary IP configurations, you can only ping to the Internet if the configuration has a public IP address associated with it. For primary IP configurations, a public IP address is not required to ping to the Internet.

For Linux VMs, when attempting to validate outbound connectivity from a secondary NIC, you may need to add appropriate routes. See appropriate documentation for your Linux distribution. The following is one method to accomplish this:

```
echo 150 custom >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables 

ip rule add from 10.1.0.5 lookup custom
ip route add default via 10.1.0.1 dev eth2 table custom

```

* Ensure to replace:

	+ **10.1.0.5** with the private IP address that has a public IP address associated to it
	+ **10.1.0.1** to your default gateway
	+ **eth2** to the name of your secondary NIC

### Ubuntu 18.04+

Expand
Ubuntu 18.04 and above have changed to **`netplan`** for OS network management. We recommend looking at the latest documentation for your Linux distribution.

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Ensure you're the root user. If you are not, enter the following command:

```
sudo -i

```
3. Create a file for the second interface and open it in a text editor:

```
vi /etc/netplan/60-static.yaml

```
4. Add the following lines to the file, replacing **`10.1.0.5/24`** with your IP and subnet mask:

```
network:
    version: 2
    ethernets:
        eth0:
            addresses:
                - 10.1.0.5/24

```

To add additional private IP addresses, edit the file and add the new private IP addresses on subsequent lines:

```
network:
    version: 2
    ethernets:
        eth0:
            addresses:
                - 10.1.0.5/24
                - 10.1.0.6/24

```
5. Save the file by using the following command:

```
:wq

```
6. Test the changes with [netplan try](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/kinetic/en/man8/netplan-try.8.html) to confirm syntax:

```
netplan try

```

Note

`netplan try` will apply the changes temporarily and roll the changes back after 120 seconds. If there is a loss of connectivity, please wait 120 seconds, and then reconnect. At that time, the changes will have been rolled back.
7. Assuming no issues with **`netplan try`**, apply the configuration changes:

```
netplan apply

```
8. Verify the IP address is added to the network interface with the following command:

```
ip addr list eth0

```

You should see the IP address you added as part of the list. Example:

```
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
link/ether 00:0d:3a:04:45:16 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
inet 10.1.0.5/24 brd 10.1.0.255 scope global eth0
   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
inet 10.1.0.6/24 brd 10.1.0.255 scope global secondary eth0
   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
inet 10.1.0.4/24 brd 10.1.0.255 scope global secondary eth0
   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

#### Validation (Red Hat, CentOS, and others)

To ensure you're able to connect to the internet from your secondary IP configuration via the public IP associated with it, use the following command:

```
ping -I 10.0.0.5 outlook.com

```

Note

For secondary IP configurations, you can only ping to the Internet if the configuration has a public IP address associated with it. For primary IP configurations, a public IP address is not required to ping to the Internet.

For Linux VMs, when attempting to validate outbound connectivity from a secondary NIC, you may need to add appropriate routes. Please see appropriate documentation for your Linux distribution. The following is one method to accomplish this:

```
echo 150 custom >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables 

ip rule add from 10.1.0.5 lookup custom
ip route add default via 10.1.0.1 dev eth2 table custom

```

* Ensure to replace:

	+ **10.0.0.5** with the private IP address that has a public IP address associated to it
	+ **10.0.0.1** to your default gateway
	+ **eth2** to the name of your secondary NIC

### Debian GNU/Linux

Expand
We recommend looking at the latest documentation for your Linux distribution.

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Ensure you're the root user. If you aren't, enter the following command:

```
sudo -i

```
3. Update the configuration file of the network interface (assuming **âeth0â**).

	* Keep the existing line item for dhcp. The primary IP address remains configured as it was previously.
	* Add a configuration for an additional static IP address with the following commands:

	```
	cd /etc/network/interfaces.d/
	ls

	```

	You should see a .cfg file.
4. Open the file. You should see the following lines at the end of the file:

```
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

```
5. Add the following lines after the lines that exist in the file. Replace **`10.1.0.5`** with your private IP address and subnet mask.

```
iface eth0 inet static
address 10.1.0.5
netmask 255.255.255.0

```

To add additional private IP addresses, edit the file and add the new private IP addresses on subsequent lines:

```
iface eth0 inet static
address 10.1.0.5
netmask 255.255.255.0
iface eth0 inet static
address 10.1.0.6
netmask 255.255.255.0

```
6. Save the file by using the following command:

```
:wq

```
7. Restart networking services for the changes to take effect. For Debian 8 and above, this can be done using below command :

```
systemctl restart networking

```

For prior versions of Debian, you can use below commands:

```
service networking restart

```
8. Verify the IP address is added to the network interface with the following command:

```
ip addr list eth0

```

You should see the IP address you added as part of the list. Example:

```
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
link/ether 00:0d:3a:04:45:16 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
inet 10.1.0.5/24 brd 10.1.0.255 scope global eth0
   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
inet 10.1.0.6/24 brd 10.1.0.255 scope global secondary eth0
   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
inet 10.1.0.4/24 brd 10.1.0.255 scope global secondary eth0
   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
inet6 fe80::20d:3aff:fe04:4516/64 scope link
   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

```

#### Validation (Debian GNU/Linux)

To ensure you're able to connect to the internet from your secondary IP configuration via the public IP associated with it, use the following command:

```
ping -I 10.1.0.5 outlook.com

```

Note

For secondary IP configurations, you can only ping to the Internet if the configuration has a public IP address associated with it. For primary IP configurations, a public IP address is not required to ping to the Internet.

For Linux VMs, when attempting to validate outbound connectivity from a secondary NIC, you may need to add appropriate routes. See appropriate documentation for your Linux distribution. The following is one method to accomplish this:

```
echo 150 custom >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables 

ip rule add from 10.1.0.5 lookup custom
ip route add default via 10.1.0.1 dev eth2 table custom

```

* Ensure to replace:

	+ **10.1.0.5** with the private IP address that has a public IP address associated to it
	+ **10.1.0.1** to your default gateway
	+ **eth2** to the name of your secondary NIC
