## In this article

VM Applications are a resource type in Azure Compute Gallery (formerly known as Shared Image Gallery) that simplifies management, sharing, and global distribution of applications for your virtual machines.

While you can create an image of a VM with apps preinstalled, you would need to update your image each time you have application changes. Separating your application installation from your VM images means thereâs no need to publish a new image for every line of code change.

Application packages provide benefits over other deployment and packaging methods:

* VM Applications have support for [Azure Policies](../governance/policy/overview)
* Grouping and versioning of your packages
* VM applications can be globally replicated to be closer to your infrastructure, so you donât need to use AzCopy or other storage copy mechanisms to copy the bits across Azure regions.
* Sharing with other users through Azure Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Support for virtual machines, and both flexible and uniform scale sets
* If you have Network Security Group (NSG) rules applied on your VM or scale set, downloading the packages from an internet repository might not be possible. And with storage accounts, downloading packages onto locked-down VMs would require setting up private links.

## What are VM app packages?

The VM application packages use multiple resource types:

| Resource | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Azure compute gallery** | A gallery is a repository for managing and sharing application packages. Users can share the gallery resource and all the child resources are shared automatically. The gallery name must be unique per subscription. For example, you may have one gallery to store all your OS images and another gallery to store all your VM applications. |
| **VM application** | The definition of your VM application. It's a *logical* resource that stores the common metadata for all the versions under it. For example, you may have an application definition for Apache Tomcat and have multiple versions within it. |
| **VM Application version** | The deployable resource. You can globally replicate your VM application versions to target regions closer to your VM infrastructure. The VM Application Version must be replicated to a region before it may be deployed on a VM in that region. |

## Limitations

* **No more than 3 replicas per region**: When you're creating a VM Application version, the maximum number of replicas per region is three.
* **Public access on storage**: Only public level access to storage accounts work, as other restriction levels fail deployments.
* **Retrying failed installations**: Currently, the only way to retry a failed installation is to remove the application from the profile, then add it back.
* **Only 25 applications per VM**: No more than 25 applications may be deployed to a VM at any point.
* **2GB application size**: The maximum file size of an application version is 2 GB.
* **No guarantees on reboots in your script**: If your script requires a reboot, the recommendation is to place that application last during deployment. While the code attempts to handle reboots, it may fail.
* **Requires a VM Agent**: The VM agent must exist on the VM and be able to receive goal states.
* **Multiple versions of same application on the same VM**: You can't have multiple versions of the same application on a VM.
* **Move operations currently not supported**: Moving VMs with VM Apps to other resource groups aren't supported at this time.

Note

For Azure Compute Gallery and VM Applications, Storage SAS can be deleted after replication.

## Cost

There's no extra charge for using VM Application Packages, but you're charged for the following resources:

* Storage costs of storing each package and any replicas.
* Network egress charges for replication of the first image version from the source region to the replicated regions. Subsequent replicas are handled within the region, so there are no extra charges.

For more information on network egress, see [Bandwidth pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/bandwidth/).

## VM applications

The VM application resource defines the following about your VM application:

* Azure Compute Gallery where the VM application is stored
* Name of the application
* Supported OS type like Linux or Windows
* A description of the VM application

## VM application versions

VM application versions are the deployable resource. Versions are defined with the following properties:

* Version number
* Link to the application package file in a storage account
* Install string for installing the application
* Remove string to show how to properly remove the app
* Package file name to use when it's downloaded to the VM
* Configuration file name to be used to configure the app on the VM
* A link to the configuration file for the VM application, which you can include license files
* Update string for how to update the VM application to a newer version
* End-of-life date. End-of-life dates are informational; you're still able to deploy VM application versions past the end-of-life date.
* Exclude from latest. You can keep a version from being used as the latest version of the application.
* Target regions for replication
* Replica count per region

## Download directory

The download location of the application package and the configuration files are:

* Linux: `/var/lib/waagent/Microsoft.CPlat.Core.VMApplicationManagerLinux/<appname>/<app version>`
* Windows: `C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.CPlat.Core.VMApplicationManagerWindows\1.0.9\Downloads\<appname>\<app version>`

The install/update/remove commands should be written assuming the application package and the configuration file are in the current directory.

## File naming

When the application file gets downloaded to the VM, the file name is the same as the name you use when you create the VM application. For example, if I name my VM application `myApp`, the file that is downloaded to the VM is also named `myApp`, regardless of what the file name is used in the storage account. If your VM application also has a configuration file, that file is the name of the application with `_config` appended. If `myApp` has a configuration file, it's named `myApp_config`.

For example, if I name my VM application `myApp` when I create it in the Gallery, but it's stored as `myApplication.exe` in the storage account, when it gets downloaded to the VM the file name is `myApp`. My install string should start by renaming the file to be whatever it needs to be to run on the VM (like `myApp.exe`).

The install, update, and remove commands must be written with file naming in mind. The `configFileName` is assigned to the config file for the VM and `packageFileName` is the name assigned downloaded package on the VM. For more information regarding these other VM settings, see [UserArtifactSettings](/en-us/rest/api/compute/gallery-application-versions/create-or-update?tabs=HTTP#userartifactsettings) in our API docs.

## Command interpreter

The default command interpreters are:

* Linux: `/bin/bash`
* Windows: `cmd.exe`

It's possible to use a different interpreter like Chocolatey or PowerShell, as long as it's installed on the machine, by calling the executable and passing the command to it. For example, to have your command run in PowerShell on Windows instead of cmd, you can pass `powershell.exe -Command '<powershell commmand>'`

## How updates are handled

When you update an application version on a VM or Virtual Machine Scale Sets, the update command you provided during deployment is used. If the updated version doesn't have an update command, then the current version is removed and the new version is installed.

Update commands should be written with the expectation that it could be updating from any older version of the VM application.

## Tips for creating VM Applications on Linux

Third party applications for Linux can be packaged in a few ways. Let's explore how to handle creating the install commands for some of the most common.

### .tar and .gz files

These files are compressed archives and can be extracted to a desired location. Check the installation instructions for the original package to in case they need to be extracted to a specific location. If .tar.gz file contains source code, see the instructions for the package for how to install from source.

Example to install command to install `golang` on a Linux machine:

```
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go_linux

```

Example remove command:

```
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go

```

### Creating application packages using `.deb`, `.rpm`, and other platform specific packages for VMs with restricted internet access

You can download individual packages for platform specific package managers, but they usually don't contain all the dependencies. For these files, you must also include all dependencies in the application package, or have the system package manager download the dependencies through the repositories that are available to the VM. If you're working with a VM with restricted internet access, you must package all the dependencies yourself.

Figuring out the dependencies can be a bit tricky. There are third party tools that can show you the entire dependency tree.

* [Ubuntu](#tabpanel_1_ubuntu)
* [Red Hat](#tabpanel_1_rhel)
* [SUSE](#tabpanel_1_sles)

In Ubuntu, you can run `sudo apt show <package_name> | grep Depends` to show all the packages that are installed when executing the `sudo apt-get install <packge_name>` command. Then you can use that output to download all `.deb` files to create an archive that can be used as the application package.

1. Example, to create a VM application package to install PowerShell for Ubuntu, first run the following commands to enable the repository where PowerShell can be downloaded from and also to identify the package dependencies on a new Ubuntu VM.

```
# Download the Microsoft repository GPG keys
wget -q "https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/$(lsb_release -rs)/packages-microsoft-prod.deb"
# Register the Microsoft repository GPG keys
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo rm -rf packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo apt update
sudo apt show powershell | grep Depends

```

2. Check the output of the line **Depends** which lists the following packages:

```
Depends: libc6, libgcc1, libgssapi-krb5-2, libstdc++6, zlib1g, libicu72|libicu71|libicu70|libicu69|libicu68|libicu67|libicu66|libicu65|libicu63|libicu60|libicu57|libicu55|libicu52, libssl3|libssl1.1|libssl1.0.2|libssl1.

```

3. Download each of these files using `sudo apt-get download <package_name>` and create a tar compressed archive with all files.

* Ubuntu 18.04:

```
mkdir /tmp/powershell
cd /tmp/powershell
sudo apt-get download libc6
sudo apt-get download libgcc1
sudo apt-get download libgssapi-krb5-2
sudo apt-get download libstdc++6
sudo apt-get download zlib1g
sudo apt-get download libssl1.1
sudo apt-get download libicu60
sudo apt-get download powershell
sudo tar -cvzf powershell.tar.gz *.deb

```

* Ubuntu 20.04:

```
mkdir /tmp/powershell
cd /tmp/powershell
sudo apt-get download libc6
sudo apt-get download libgcc1
sudo apt-get download libgssapi-krb5-2
sudo apt-get download libstdc++6
sudo apt-get download zlib1g
sudo apt-get download libssl1.1
sudo apt-get download libicu66
sudo apt-get download powershell
sudo tar -cvzf powershell.tar.gz *.deb

```

* Ubuntu 22.04:

```
mkdir /tmp/powershell
cd /tmp/powershell
sudo apt-get download libc6
sudo apt-get download libgcc1
sudo apt-get download libgssapi-krb5-2
sudo apt-get download libstdc++6
sudo apt-get download zlib1g
sudo apt-get download libssl3
sudo apt-get download libicu70
sudo apt-get download powershell
sudo tar -cvzf powershell.tar.gz *.deb

```

4. This tar archive is the application package file.

* The install command in this case is:

```
sudo tar -xvzf powershell.tar.gz && sudo dpkg -i *.deb

```

* And the remove command is:

```
sudo apt remove powershell

```

Use `sudo apt autoremove` instead of explicitly trying to remove all the dependencies. You may have installed other applications with overlapping dependencies, and in that case, an explicit remove command would fail.

In case you don't want to resolve the dependencies yourself, and `apt` is able to connect to the repositories, you can install an application with just one `.deb` file and let `apt` handle the dependencies.

Example install command:

```
dpkg -i <package_name> || apt --fix-broken install -y

```

In Red Hat, you can run `sudo yum deplist <package_name>` to show all the packages that are installed when executing the `sudo yum install <package_name>` command. Then you can use that output to download all `.rpm` files to create an archive that can be used as the application package.

1. Example, to create a VM application package to install PowerShell for Red Hat, first run the following commands to enable the repository where PowerShell can be downloaded from and also to identify the package dependencies on a new RHEL VM.

* RHEL 7:

```
# Register the Microsoft RedHat repository
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/7/prod.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/microsoft.repo

sudo yum deplist powershell

```

* RHEL 8:

```
# Register the Microsoft RedHat repository
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/8/prod.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/microsoft.repo

sudo dnf deplist powershell

```

2. Check the output of each of the dependency entries, the dependencies are named after `provider:`:

```
  dependency: /bin/sh
   provider: bash.x86_64 4.2.46-35.el7_9
  dependency: libicu
   provider: libicu.x86_64 50.2-4.el7_7
   provider: libicu.i686 50.2-4.el7_7
  dependency: openssl-libs
   provider: openssl-libs.x86_64 1:1.0.2k-26.el7_9
   provider: openssl-libs.i686 1:1.0.2k-26.el7_9

```

3. Download each of these files using `sudo yum install --downloadonly <package_name>`, to download a package when isn't yet installed in the system, or `sudo yum reinstall --downloadonly <package_name>`, to download a package that's already installed in the system, and create a tar compressed archive with all files.

```
mkdir /tmp/powershell
cd /tmp/powershell
sudo yum reinstall --downloadonly --downloaddir=/tmp/powershell bash
sudo yum reinstall --downloadonly --downloaddir=/tmp/powershell libicu
sudo yum reinstall --downloadonly --downloaddir=/tmp/powershell openssl-libs
sudo yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=/tmp/powershell powershell
sudo tar -cvzf powershell.tar.gz *.rpm

```

4. This tar archive is the application package file.

* The install command in this case is:

```
sudo tar -xvzf powershell.tar.gz && sudo yum install *.rpm -y

```

* And the remove command is:

```
sudo yum remove powershell

```

In case you don't want to resolve the dependencies yourself and yum/dnf is able to connect to the repositories, you can install an application with just one `.rpm` file and let yum/dnf handle the dependencies.

Example install command:

```
yum install <package.rpm> -y

```

In SUSE, you can run `sudo zypper info --requires <package_name>` to show all the packages that are installed when executing the `sudo zypper install <package_name>` command. Then you can use that output to download all `.rpm` files to create an archive that can be used as the application package.

1. Example, to create a VM application package to install `azure-cli` for SUSE, first run the following commands to enable the repository where Azure CLI can be downloaded from and also to identify the package dependencies on a new SUSE VM.

```
sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
sudo zypper addrepo --name 'Azure CLI' --check https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/azure-cli azure-cli
sudo zypper info --requires azure-cli

```

2. Check the output after **Requires** which lists the following packages:

```

    python3-azure-mgmt-security >= 0.6.0

```

3. Download each of these files using `sudo zypper install -f --download-only <package_name>` and create a tar compressed archive with all files.

```
mkdir /tmp/azurecli
cd /tmp/azurecli
for i in $(sudo zypper info --requires azure-cli | sed -n -e '/Requires*/,$p' | grep -v "Requires" | awk -F '[>=]' '{print $1}') ; do sudo zypper --non-interactive --pkg-cache-dir /tmp/azurecli install -f --download-only $i; done
for i in $(sudo find /tmp/azurecli -name "*.rpm") ; do sudo cp $i /tmp/azurecli; done
sudo tar -cvzf azurecli.tar.gz *.rpm

```

4. This tar archive is the application package file.

* The install command in this case is:

```
sudo tar -xvzf azurecli.tar.gz && sudo zypper --no-refresh --no-remote --non-interactive install *.rpm

```

* And the remove command is:

```
sudo zypper remove azure-cli

```

## Tips for creating VM Applications on Windows

Most third party applications in Windows are available as .exe or .msi installers. Some are also available as extract and run zip files. Let us look at the best practices for each of them.

### .exe installer

Installer executables typically launch a user interface (UI) and require someone to select through the UI. If the installer supports a silent mode parameter, it should be included in your installation string.

Cmd.exe also expects executable files to have the extension `.exe`, so you need to rename the file to have the `.exe` extension.

If I want to create a VM application package for `myApp.exe`, which ships as an executable, my VM Application is called 'myApp', so I write the command assuming the application package is in the current directory:

```
"move .\\myApp .\\myApp.exe & myApp.exe /S -config myApp_config" 

```

If the installer executable file doesn't support an uninstall parameter, you can sometimes look up the registry on a test machine to know here the uninstaller is located.

In the registry, the uninstall string is stored in `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\<installed application name>\UninstallString` so I would use the contents as my remove command:

```
'\"C:\\Program Files\\myApp\\uninstall\\helper.exe\" /S'

```

### .msi installer

For command line execution of `.msi` installers, the commands to install or remove an application should use `msiexec`. Typically, `msiexec` runs as its own separate process and `cmd` doesn't wait for it to complete, which can lead to problems when installing more than one VM application. The `start` command can be used with `msiexec` to ensure that the installation completes before the command returns. For example:

```
start /wait %windir%\\system32\\msiexec.exe /i myapp /quiet /forcerestart /log myapp_install.log

```

Example remove command:

```
start /wait %windir%\\system32\\msiexec.exe /x $appname /quiet /forcerestart /log ${appname}_uninstall.log

```

### Zipped files

For .zip or other zipped files, rename and unzip the contents of the application package to the desired destination.

Example install command:

```
rename myapp myapp.zip && mkdir C:\myapp && powershell.exe -Command "Expand-Archive -path myapp.zip -destinationpath C:\myapp"

```

Example remove command:

```
rmdir /S /Q C:\\myapp

```

## Treat failure as deployment failure

The VM application extension always returns a *success* regardless of whether any VM app failed while being installed/updated/removed. The VM Application extension only reports the extension status as failure when there's a problem with the extension or the underlying infrastructure. This behavior is triggered by the "treat failure as deployment failure" flag, which is set to `$false` by default and can be changed to `$true`. The failure flag can be configured in [PowerShell](/en-us/powershell/module/az.compute/add-azvmgalleryapplication#parameters) or [CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/vm/application#az-vm-application-set).

## Troubleshooting VM Applications

To know whether a particular VM application was successfully added to the VM instance, check the message of the VM Application extension.

To learn more about getting the status of VM extensions, see [Virtual machine extensions and features for Linux](extensions/features-linux#view-extension-status) and [Virtual machine extensions and features for Windows](extensions/features-windows#view-extension-status).

To get status of VM extensions, use [Get-AzVM](/en-us/powershell/module/az.compute/get-azvm):

```
Get-AzVM -name <VM name> -ResourceGroupName <resource group name> -Status | convertto-json -Depth 10    

```

To get status of scale set extensions, use [Get-AzVMSS](/en-us/powershell/module/az.compute/get-azvmss):

```
$result = Get-AzVmssVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -VMScaleSetName $vmssName -InstanceView
$resultSummary  = New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList
$result | ForEach-Object {
    $res = @{ instanceId = $_.InstanceId; vmappStatus = $_.InstanceView.Extensions | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "VMAppExtension"}}
    $resultSummary.Add($res) | Out-Null
}
$resultSummary | convertto-json -depth 5  

```
