Azure Disk Storage supports double encryption at rest for managed disks. For conceptual information on double encryption at rest, and other managed disk encryption types, see the [Double encryption at rest](disk-encryption#double-encryption-at-rest) section of our disk encryption article.

## Restrictions

Double encryption at rest isn't currently supported with either Ultra Disks or Premium SSD v2 disks.

## Getting started

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Search for and select **Disk Encryption Sets**.

3. Select **+ Create**.
4. Select one of the supported regions.
5. For **Encryption type**, select **Double encryption with platform-managed and customer-managed keys**.

Note

Once you create a disk encryption set with a particular encryption type, it cannot be changed. If you want to use a different encryption type, you must create a new disk encryption set.
6. Fill in the remaining info.

7. Select an Azure Key Vault and key, or create a new one if necessary.

Note

If you create a Key Vault instance, you must enable soft delete and purge protection. These settings are mandatory when using a Key Vault for encrypting managed disks, and protect you from losing data due to accidental deletion.

8. Select **Create**.
9. Navigate to the disk encryption set you created, and select the error that is displayed. This will configure your disk encryption set to work.

[![Screenshot of the disk encryption set displayed error, the error text is: To associate a disk, image, or snapshot with this disk encryption set, you must grant permissions to the key vault.](media/virtual-machines-disks-double-encryption-at-rest-portal/double-encryption-disk-set-error.png)](media/virtual-machines-disks-double-encryption-at-rest-portal/double-encryption-disk-set-error.png#lightbox)

A notification should pop up and succeed. Doing this will allow you to use the disk encryption set with your key vault.

10. Navigate to your disk.
11. Select **Encryption**.
12. For **Key management**, select one of the keys under **Platform-managed and customer-managed keys**.
13. select **Save**.

[![Screenshot of the encryption blade for your managed disk, the aforementioned encryption type is highlighted.](media/virtual-machines-disks-double-encryption-at-rest-portal/double-encryption-enable-disk-blade.png)](media/virtual-machines-disks-double-encryption-at-rest-portal/double-encryption-enable-disk-blade.png#lightbox)

You have now enabled double encryption at rest on your managed disk.
