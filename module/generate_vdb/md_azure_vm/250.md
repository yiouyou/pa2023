## In this article

Azure Dedicated Host SKUs are the combination of a VM family and a certain hardware specification. You can only deploy VMs of the VM series that the Dedicated Host SKU specifies. For example, on the Dsv3-Type3, you can only provision [Dsv3-series](dv3-dsv3-series#dsv3-series) VMs.

This document goes through the hardware specifications and VM packings for all GPU optimized Dedicated Host SKUs.

## Limitations

The sizes and hardware types available for dedicated hosts vary by region. Refer to the host [pricing page](https://aka.ms/ADHPricing) to learn more.

## NVasv4

### NVasv4-Type1

The NVasv4-Type1 is a Dedicated Host SKU utilizing the AMDÂ® Rome (EPYCâ¢ 7V12) processor with AMD Radeon Instinct MI25 GPUs. It offers 128 physical cores, 128 vCPUs, and 448 GiB of RAM. The NVasv4-Type1 runs [NVsv4-series](nvv4-series) VMs.

The following packing configuration outlines the max packing of uniform VMs you can put onto a NVasv4-Type1 host.

| Physical cores | Available vCPUs | Available RAM | VM Size | # VMs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 128 | 128 | 448 GiB | NV4as v4 | 30 |
|  |  |  | NV8as v4 | 15 |
|  |  |  | NV16as v4 | 7 |
|  |  |  | NV32as v4 | 3 |

### NVsv3-Type1

The NVsv3-Type1 is a Dedicated Host SKU utilizing the IntelÂ® Broadwell (E5-2690 v4) processor with NVIDIA Tesla M60 GPUs and NVIDIA GRID technology. It offers 28 physical cores, 48 vCPUs, and 448 GiB of RAM. The NVsv3-Type1 runs [NVv3-series](nvv3-series) VMs.

The following packing configuration outlines the max packing of uniform VMs you can put onto a NVsv3-Type1 host.

| Physical cores | Available vCPUs | Available RAM | VM Size | # VMs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 28 | 48 | 448 GiB | NV12s v3 | 4 |
