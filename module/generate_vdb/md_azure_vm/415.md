The Azure CLI is used to create and manage Azure resources from the command line or in scripts. This quickstart shows you how to use the Azure CLI to create and encrypt a Windows Server 2016 virtual machine (VM).

If you don't have an [Azure subscription](../../guides/developer/azure-developer-guide#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing), create an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

* Use the Bash environment in [Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see [Quickstart for Bash in Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).

[![](../../reusable-content/azure-cli/media/hdi-launch-cloud-shell.png)](https://shell.azure.com)
* If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally, [install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see [How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).

	+ If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the [az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see [Sign in with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).
	+ When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see [Use extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).
	+ Run [az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version) to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run [az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).

* This article requires version 2.0.30 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Create a resource group

Create a resource group with the [az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command. An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location:

```
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus

```

## Create a virtual machine

Create a VM with [az vm create](/en-us/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-create). The following example creates a VM named *myVM*. This example uses *azureuser* for an administrative user name and *myPassword12* as the password.

```
az vm create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myVM \
    --image win2016datacenter \
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --admin-password myPassword12

```

It takes a few minutes to create the VM and supporting resources. The following example output shows the VM create operation was successful.

```
{
  "fqdns": "",
  "id": "/subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM",
  "location": "eastus",
  "macAddress": "00-0D-3A-23-9A-49",
  "powerState": "VM running",
  "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.4",
  "publicIpAddress": "52.174.34.95",
  "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup"
}

```

## Create a Key Vault configured for encryption keys

Azure disk encryption stores its encryption key in an Azure Key Vault. Create a Key Vault with [az keyvault create](/en-us/cli/azure/keyvault#az-keyvault-create). To enable the Key Vault to store encryption keys, use the--enabled-for-disk-encryption parameter.

Important

Each Key Vault must have a unique name. This example creates a Key Vault named *myKV*, but you must name yours something different.

```
az keyvault create --name "myKV" --resource-group "myResourceGroup" --location eastus --enabled-for-disk-encryption

```

## Encrypt the virtual machine

Encrypt your VM with [az vm encryption](/en-us/cli/azure/vm/encryption), providing your unique Key Vault name to the --disk-encryption-keyvault parameter.

```
az vm encryption enable -g MyResourceGroup --name MyVM --disk-encryption-keyvault myKV

```

You can verify that encryption is enabled on your VM with [az vm show](/en-us/cli/azure/vm/encryption#az-vm-encryption-show)

```
az vm encryption show --name MyVM -g MyResourceGroup

```

You will see the following in the returned output:

```
"EncryptionOperation": "EnableEncryption"

```

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use the [az group delete](/en-us/cli/azure/group) command to remove the resource group, VM, and Key Vault.

```
az group delete --name myResourceGroup

```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created a virtual machine, created a Key Vault that was enabled for encryption keys, and encrypted the VM. Advance to the next article to learn more about Azure Disk Encryption prerequisites for IaaS VMs.
