The Edv4 and Edsv4-series run on the 3rd Generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) or the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake) processors in a hyper-threaded configuration, and are ideal for various memory-intensive enterprise applications and feature up to 504 GiB of RAM, [IntelÂ® Turbo Boost Technology 2.0](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [IntelÂ® Hyper-Threading Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html) and [IntelÂ® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (IntelÂ® AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html). They also support [IntelÂ® Deep Learning Boost](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai/deep-learning-boost.html). These new VM sizes will have 50% larger local storage, as well as better local disk IOPS for both read and write compared to the [Ev3/Esv3](ev3-esv3-series) sizes with [Gen2 VMs](generation-2). It features an all core Turbo clock speed of 3.4 GHz.

## Edv4-series

Edv4-series sizes run on the 3rd Generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) or the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake) processors. The Edv4 virtual machine sizes feature up to 504 GiB of RAM, in addition to fast and large local SSD storage (up to 2,400 GiB). These virtual machines are ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications and applications that benefit from low latency, high-speed local storage. You can attach Standard SSDs and Standard HDDs disk storage to the Edv4 VMs.

\* These IOPs values can be guaranteed by using [Gen2 VMs](generation-2)

1 Edsv4-series VMs can [burst](disk-bursting) their disk performance and get up to their bursting max for up to 30 minutes at a time.

2 [Constrained core sizes available](constrained-vcpu).

3 Instance is isolated to hardware dedicated to a single customer.

4 Accelerated networking can only be applied to a single NIC.

5 Attaching Ultra Disk or Premium SSDs V2 to **Standard\_E80ids\_v4** results in higher IOPs and MBps than standard premium disks:

* Max uncached Ultra Disk and Premium SSD V2 throughput (IOPS/ MBps): 120000/1800
* Max burst uncached Ultra Disk and Premium SSD V2 disk throughput (IOPS/ MBps): 120000/2000

## Size table definitions

* Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
* Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
* Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **ReadOnly** or **ReadWrite**. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **None**.
* To learn how to get the best storage performance for your VMs, see [Virtual machine and disk performance](disks-performance).
* **Expected network bandwidth** is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, see [Virtual machine network bandwidth](../virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput).

Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, see [Optimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines](../virtual-network/virtual-network-optimize-network-bandwidth). To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, see [Bandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP)](../virtual-network/virtual-network-bandwidth-testing).
