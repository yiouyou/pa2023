Azure Storage Explorer contains a rich set of features that allows you to:

* Upload, download, and copy managed disks.
* Create snapshots from operating system or data disk virtual hard disk.
* Migrate data from on-premises to Azure.
* Migrate data across Azure regions.

## Prerequisites

To complete this article, you'll need:

* An Azure subscription.
* At least one Azure managed disk.
* The latest version of [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/).

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
