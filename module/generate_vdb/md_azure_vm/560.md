## In this article

The first step in understanding compliance in Azure is to identify the status of your resources.
This quickstart steps you through the process of using an Azure Resource Manager template (ARM
template) to create a policy assignment that identifies virtual machines that aren't using managed
disks, and flags them as *non-compliant* to the policy assignment.

A [resource manager template](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. The template uses declarative syntax. In declarative syntax, you describe your intended deployment without writing the sequence of programming commands to create the deployment.

If your environment meets the prerequisites and you're familiar with using ARM templates, select the
**Deploy to Azure** button. The template will open in the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) account
before you begin.

## Review the template

In this quickstart, you create a policy assignment and assign a built-in policy definition called
*Audit VMs that do not use managed disks*. For a partial list of available built-in policies, see
[Azure Policy samples](samples/).

The template used in this quickstart is from
[Azure Quickstart Templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/azurepolicy-assign-builtinpolicy-resourcegroup/).

```

{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
    "policyAssignmentName": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "[guid(parameters('policyDefinitionID'), resourceGroup().name)]",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Specifies the name of the policy assignment, can be used defined or an idempotent name as the defaultValue provides."
      }
    },
    "policyDefinitionID": {
      "type": "string",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Specifies the ID of the policy definition or policy set definition being assigned."
      }
    }
  },
  "resources": [
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments",
      "name": "[parameters('policyAssignmentName')]",
      "apiVersion": "2019-09-01",
      "properties": {
        "scope": "[subscriptionResourceId('Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups', resourceGroup().name)]",
        "policyDefinitionId": "[parameters('policyDefinitionID')]"
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

The resource defined in the template is:

* [Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments](/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.authorization/policyassignments)

## Deploy the template

Note

Azure Policy service is free. For more information, see
[Overview of Azure Policy](overview).

1. Select the following image to sign in to the Azure portal and open the template:

[![Button to deploy the ARM template for assigning an Azure Policy to Azure.](../../media/template-deployments/deploy-to-azure.svg)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2Fquickstarts%2Fmicrosoft.authorization%2Fazurepolicy-assign-builtinpolicy-resourcegroup%2Fazuredeploy.json)
2. Select or enter the following values:

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Subscription | Select your Azure subscription. |
| Resource group | Select **Create new**, specify a name, and then select **OK**. In the screenshot, the resource group name is *mypolicyquickstart<Date in MMDD>rg*. |
| Location | Select a region. For example, **Central US**. |
| Policy Assignment Name | Specify a policy assignment name. You can use the policy definition display if you want. For example, *Audit VMs that do not use managed disks*. |
| Resource Group Name | Specify a resource group name where you want to assign the policy to. In this quickstart, use the default value **[resourceGroup().name]**. **[resourceGroup()](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/template-functions-resource#resourcegroup)** is a template function that retrieves the resource group. |
| Policy Definition ID | Specify **/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/0a914e76-4921-4c19-b460-a2d36003525a**. |
| I agree to the terms and conditions stated above | (Select) |
3. Select **Purchase**.

* To learn subscription-level deployment, see
[Create resource groups and resources at the subscription level](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-to-subscription).

## Validate the deployment

Select **Compliance** in the left side of the page. Then locate the *Audit VMs that do not use
managed disks* policy assignment you created.

If there are any existing resources that aren't compliant with this new assignment, they appear
under **Non-compliant resources**.

For more information, see
[How compliance works](concepts/compliance-states).

## Clean up resources

To remove the assignment created, follow these steps:

1. Select **Compliance** (or **Assignments**) in the left side of the Azure Policy page and locate
the *Audit VMs that do not use managed disks* policy assignment you created.
2. Right-click the *Audit VMs that do not use managed disks* policy assignment and select **Delete
assignment**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you assigned a built-in policy definition to a scope and evaluated its
compliance report. The policy definition validates that all the resources in the scope are compliant
and identifies which ones aren't.
