## In this article

The first step in understanding compliance in Azure is to identify the status of your resources.
This quickstart steps you through the process of using a
[Bicep](https://github.com/Azure/bicep) file compiled to an Azure Resource
Manager (ARM) deployment template to create a policy assignment to identify virtual machines that
aren't using managed disks. At the end of this process, you'll successfully identify virtual
machines that aren't using managed disks. They're *non-compliant* with the policy assignment.

A [resource manager template](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. The template uses declarative syntax. In declarative syntax, you describe your intended deployment without writing the sequence of programming commands to create the deployment.

If your environment meets the prerequisites and you're familiar with using ARM templates, select the
**Deploy to Azure** button. The template opens in the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
account before you begin.
* Bicep version `0.3` or higher installed. If you don't yet have Bicep CLI or need to update, see
[Install Bicep](../../azure-resource-manager/bicep/install).

## Review the Bicep file

In this quickstart, you create a policy assignment and assign a built-in policy definition called [*Audit VMs that do not use managed disks*](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Compute/VMRequireManagedDisk_Audit.json). For a partial
list of available built-in policies, see [Azure Policy samples](samples/).

Create the following Bicep file as `assignment.bicep`:

```
param policyAssignmentName string = 'audit-vm-manageddisks'
param policyDefinitionID string = '/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/06a78e20-9358-41c9-923c-fb736d382a4d'

resource assignment 'Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments@2021-09-01' = {
    name: policyAssignmentName
    scope: subscriptionResourceId('Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups', resourceGroup().name)
    properties: {
        policyDefinitionId: policyDefinitionID
    }
}

output assignmentId string = assignment.id

```

The resource defined in the file is:

* [Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments](/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.authorization/policyassignments)

## Deploy the template

Note

Azure Policy service is free. For more information, see
[Overview of Azure Policy](overview).

After the Bicep CLI is installed and file created, you can deploy the Bicep file with:

* [PowerShell](#tabpanel_1_azure-powershell)
* [Azure CLI](#tabpanel_1_azure-cli)

```
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
  -Name PolicyDeployment `
  -ResourceGroupName PolicyGroup `
  -TemplateFile assignment.bicep

```

```
az deployment group create \
  --name PolicyDeployment \
  --resource-group PolicyGroup \
  --template-file assignment.bicep

```

Some other resources:

* To find more samples templates, see
[Azure Quickstart Template](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/?resourceType=Microsoft.Authorization&pageNumber=1&sort=Popular).
* To see the template reference, go to
[Azure template reference](/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.authorization/allversions).
* To learn how to develop ARM templates, see
[Azure Resource Manager documentation](../../azure-resource-manager/management/overview).
* To learn subscription-level deployment, see
[Create resource groups and resources at the subscription level](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-to-subscription).

## Validate the deployment

Select **Compliance** in the left side of the page. Then locate the *Audit VMs that do not use
managed disks* policy assignment you created.

If there are any existing resources that aren't compliant with this new assignment, they appear
under **Non-compliant resources**.

For more information, see
[How compliance works](concepts/compliance-states).

## Clean up resources

To remove the assignment created, follow these steps:

1. Select **Compliance** (or **Assignments**) in the left side of the Azure Policy page and locate
the *Audit VMs that do not use managed disks* policy assignment you created.
2. Right-click the *Audit VMs that do not use managed disks* policy assignment and select **Delete
assignment**.

3. Delete the `assignment.bicep` file.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you assigned a built-in policy definition to a scope and evaluated its
compliance report. The policy definition validates that all the resources in the scope are compliant
and identifies which ones aren't.

To learn more about assigning policies to validate that new resources are compliant, continue to the
