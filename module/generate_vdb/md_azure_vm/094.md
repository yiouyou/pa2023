The M-series offers a high vCPU count (up to 128 vCPUs) and a large amount of memory (up to 3.8 TiB). It's also ideal for extremely large databases or other applications that benefit from high vCPU counts and large amounts of memory. M-series sizes are supported both on the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® CPU E7-8890 v3 @ 2.50GHz and on the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8280M (Cascade Lake).

M-series VM's feature IntelÂ® Hyper-Threading Technology.

1 More than 64 vCPU's require one of these supported guest versions: Windows Server 2016, Ubuntu 18.04+ LTS, SLES 12 SP2+, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7/8/9, CentOS 7.3+ or Oracle Linux 7.3+ with LIS 4.2.1 or higher.

2 Instance is isolated to hardware dedicated to a single customer.

3 [Constrained core sizes available](constrained-vcpu).

4 M-series VMs can [burst](disk-bursting) their disk performance for up to 30 minutes at a time.

## Size table definitions

* Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
* Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
* Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **ReadOnly** or **ReadWrite**. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **None**.
* To learn how to get the best storage performance for your VMs, see [Virtual machine and disk performance](disks-performance).
* **Expected network bandwidth** is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, see [Virtual machine network bandwidth](../virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput).

Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, see [Optimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines](../virtual-network/virtual-network-optimize-network-bandwidth). To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, see [Bandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP)](../virtual-network/virtual-network-bandwidth-testing).
