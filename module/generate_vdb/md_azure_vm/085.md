The Ev4 and Esv4-series run on the 3rd Generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) or the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake) processors in a hyper-threaded configuration, are ideal for various memory-intensive enterprise applications and feature up to 504GiB of RAM. It features an all core Turbo clock speed of 3.4 GHz.

Note

For frequently asked questions, refer to [Azure VM sizes with no local temp disk](azure-vms-no-temp-disk).

## Ev4-series

Ev4-series sizes run on the 3rd Generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) or the Intel XeonÂ® Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake). The Ev4-series instances are ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications. Ev4-series VMs feature IntelÂ® Hyper-Threading Technology.

Remote Data disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. To use premium storage disks, use the Esv4 sizes. The pricing and billing meters for Esv4 sizes are the same as Ev4-series.

1 Esv4-series VMs can [burst](disk-bursting) their disk performance and get up to their bursting max for up to 30 minutes at a time.

2 [Constrained core sizes available)](constrained-vcpu).

3 Instance is isolated to hardware dedicated to a single customer.

4 Accelerated networking can only be applied to a single NIC.

5 Attaching Ultra Disk or Premium SSDs V2 to **Standard\_E80is\_v4** results in higher IOPs and MBps than standard premium disks:

* Max uncached Ultra Disk and Premium SSD V2throughput (IOPS/ MBps): 120000/1800
* Max burst uncached Ultra Disk and Premium SSD V2 disk throughput (IOPS/ MBps): 120000/2000

## Size table definitions

* Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
* Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
* Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **ReadOnly** or **ReadWrite**. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **None**.
* To learn how to get the best storage performance for your VMs, see [Virtual machine and disk performance](disks-performance).
* **Expected network bandwidth** is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, see [Virtual machine network bandwidth](../virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput).

Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, see [Optimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines](../virtual-network/virtual-network-optimize-network-bandwidth). To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, see [Bandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP)](../virtual-network/virtual-network-bandwidth-testing).
