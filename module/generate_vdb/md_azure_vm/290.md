You can create SSH keys before creating a VM and store them in Azure. Each newly created SSH key is also stored locally.

If you have existing SSH keys, you can upload and store them in Azure for reuse.

For more information, see [Detailed steps: Create and manage SSH keys for authentication to a Linux VM in Azure](linux/create-ssh-keys-detailed).

For more information on how to create and use SSH keys with Linux VMs, see [Use SSH keys to connect to Linux VMs](linux/ssh-from-windows).

## Generate new keys

1. After you sign in, use the [az sshkey create](/en-us/cli/azure/sshkey#az-sshkey-create) command to create the new SSH key:

```
az sshkey create --name "mySSHKey" --resource-group "myResourceGroup"

```
2. The resulting output lists the new key files' paths:

```
Private key is saved to "/home/user/.ssh/7777777777_9999999".
Public key is saved to "/home/user/.ssh/7777777777_9999999.pub".

```
3. Change the permissions for the private key file for privacy:

```
chmod 600 /home/user/.ssh/7777777777_9999999

```

## Connect to the VM

On your local computer, open a Bash prompt:

```
ssh -identity_file <path to the private key file> username@<ipaddress of the VM>

```

For example, enter: `ssh -i /home/user/.ssh/mySSHKey azureuser@123.45.67.890`

## Upload an SSH key

You can upload a public SSH key to store in Azure.

Use the [az sshkey create](/en-us/cli/azure/sshkey#az-sshkey-create) command to upload an SSH public key by specifying its file:

```
az sshkey create --name "mySSHKey" --public-key "@/home/user/.ssh/7777777777_9999999.pub" --resource-group "myResourceGroup"

```

## List keys

Use the [az sshkey list](/en-us/cli/azure/sshkey#az-sshkey-list) command to list all public SSH keys, optionally specifying a resource group:

```
az sshkey list --resource-group "myResourceGroup"

```

## Get the public key

Use the [az sshkey show](/en-us/cli/azure/sshkey#az-sshkey-show) command to show the values of a public SSH key:

```
az sshkey show --name "mySSHKey" --resource-group "myResourceGroup"

```
