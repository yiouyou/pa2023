## In this article

Based on feedback weâve received from customers weâre happy to announce that we're extending the retirement date by 1 year to August 31, 2023, for the Azure NCv2-Series virtual machine to give you more time to plan your migration.

As we continue to bring modern and optimized virtual machine instances to Azure using the latest innovations in datacenter technologies, we thoughtfully plan how we retire aging hardware.
With this in mind, we are retiring our NC (v2) GPU VM sizes, powered by NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs on 31 August 2023.

## How does the NCv2-series migration affect me?

After 31 August 2023, any remaining NCv2 size virtual machines remaining in your subscription will be set to a deallocated state. These virtual machines will be stopped and removed from the host. These virtual machines will no longer be billed in the deallocated state.

This VM size retirement only impacts the VM sizes in the [NCv2-series](ncv2-series). This does not impact the newer [NCv3](ncv3-series), [NCasT4 v3](nct4-v3-series), and [NC A100 v4](nc-a100-v4-series) series virtual machines.

## What actions should I take?

You need to resize or deallocate your NC virtual machines. We recommend moving your GPU workloads to another GPU Virtual Machine size. Learn more about migrating your workloads to another [GPU Accelerated Virtual Machine size](sizes-gpu).
