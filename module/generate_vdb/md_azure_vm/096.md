The Mv2-series features high throughput, low latency platform running on a hyper-threaded IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8180M 2.5GHz (Skylake) processor with an all core base frequency of 2.5 GHz and a max turbo frequency of 3.8 GHz. All Mv2-series virtual machine sizes can use both standard and premium persistent disks. Mv2-series instances are memory optimized VM sizes providing unparalleled computational performance to support large in-memory databases and workloads, with a high memory-to-CPU ratio that is ideal for relational database servers, large caches, and in-memory analytics.

1 Mv2-series VMs are generation 2 only and support a subset of generation 2 supported Images. Please see below for the complete list of supported images for Mv2-series. If you're using Linux, see [Support for generation 2 VMs on Azure](generation-2) for instructions on how to find and select an image. If you're using Windows, see [Support for generation 2 VMs on Azure](generation-2) for instructions on how to find and select an image.

* Windows Server 2019 or later
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP4 and later or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1 and later
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 or later, and 8.1 or later
* Oracle Enterprise Linux 7.7 or later, and 8.1 or later
* Ubuntu 18.04 with the 5.4.0-azure kernel or later

## Size table definitions

* Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
* Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
* Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **ReadOnly** or **ReadWrite**. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **None**.
* To learn how to get the best storage performance for your VMs, see [Virtual machine and disk performance](disks-performance).
* **Expected network bandwidth** is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, see [Virtual machine network bandwidth](../virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput).

Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, see [Optimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines](../virtual-network/virtual-network-optimize-network-bandwidth). To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, see [Bandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP)](../virtual-network/virtual-network-bandwidth-testing).
