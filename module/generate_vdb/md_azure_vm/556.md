## In this article

The first step in understanding compliance in Azure is to identify the status of your resources. In
this quickstart, you create a policy assignment to identify virtual machines that aren't using
managed disks. When complete, you'll identify virtual machines that are *non-compliant*.

The .NET Core library is used to manage Azure resources. This guide explains how to use the .NET
Core library for Azure Policy to create a policy assignment.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a
[free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) account before you begin.
* An Azure service principal, including the *clientId* and *clientSecret*. If you don't have a
service principal for use with Azure Policy or want to create a new one, see
[Azure management libraries for .NET authentication](/en-us/dotnet/azure/sdk/authentication#mgmt-auth).
Skip the step to install the .NET Core packages as we'll do that in the next steps.

## Create the Azure Policy project

To enable .NET Core to manage Azure Policy, create a new console application and install the
required packages.

1. Check that the latest .NET Core is installed (at least **3.1.8**). If it isn't yet installed,
download it at [dotnet.microsoft.com](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).
2. Initialize a new .NET Core console application named "policyAssignment":

```
dotnet new console --name "policyAssignment"

```
3. Change directories into the new project folder and install the required packages for Azure
Policy:

```
# Add the Azure Policy package for .NET Core
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Management.ResourceManager --version 3.10.0-preview

# Add the Azure app auth package for .NET Core
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Services.AppAuthentication --version 1.5.0

```
4. Replace the default `program.cs` with the following code and save the updated file:

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory;
using Microsoft.Rest;
using Microsoft.Azure.Management.ResourceManager;
using Microsoft.Azure.Management.ResourceManager.Models;

namespace policyAssignment
{
    class Program
    {
        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            string strTenant = args[0];
            string strClientId = args[1];
            string strClientSecret = args[2];
            string strSubscriptionId = args[3];
            string strName = args[4];
            string strDisplayName = args[5];
            string strPolicyDefID = args[6];
            string strDescription = args[7];
            string strScope = args[8];

            var authContext = new AuthenticationContext($"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{strTenant}");
            var authResult = await authContext.AcquireTokenAsync(
                "https://management.core.windows.net",
                new ClientCredential(strClientId, strClientSecret));

            using (var client = new PolicyClient(new TokenCredentials(authResult.AccessToken)))
            {
                var policyAssignment = new PolicyAssignment
                {
                    DisplayName = strDisplayName,
                    PolicyDefinitionId = strPolicyDefID,
                    Description = strDescription
                };
                var response = await client.PolicyAssignments.CreateAsync(strScope, strName, policyAssignment);
            }
        }
    }
}

```
5. Build and publish the `policyAssignment` console application:

```
dotnet build
dotnet publish -o {run-folder}

```

## Create a policy assignment

In this quickstart, you create a policy assignment and assign the **Audit VMs that do not use
managed disks** (`06a78e20-9358-41c9-923c-fb736d382a4d`) definition. This policy definition
identifies resources that aren't compliant to the conditions set in the policy definition.

1. Change directories to the `{run-folder}` you defined with the previous `dotnet publish` command.
2. Enter the following command in the terminal:

```
policyAssignment.exe `
   "{tenantId}" `
   "{clientId}" `
   "{clientSecret}" `
   "{subscriptionId}" `
   "audit-vm-manageddisks" `
   "Audit VMs without managed disks Assignment" `
   "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/06a78e20-9358-41c9-923c-fb736d382a4d" `
   "Shows all virtual machines not using managed disks" `
   "{scope}"

```

The preceding commands use the following information:

* `{tenantId}` - Replace with your tenant ID
* `{clientId}` - Replace with the client ID of your service principal
* `{clientSecret}` - Replace with the client secret of your service principal
* `{subscriptionId}` - Replace with your subscription ID
* **name** - The unique name for the policy assignment object. The example above uses
*audit-vm-manageddisks*.
* **displayName** - Display name for the policy assignment. In this case, you're using *Audit VMs
without managed disks Assignment*.
* **policyDefID** - The policy definition path, based on which you're using to create the
assignment. In this case, it's the ID of policy definition *Audit VMs that do not use managed
disks*.
* **description** - A deeper explanation of what the policy does or why it's assigned to this scope.
* **scope** - A scope determines what resources or grouping of resources the policy assignment gets
enforced on. It could range from a management group to an individual resource. Be sure to replace
`{scope}` with one of the following patterns:
	+ Management group: `/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{managementGroup}`
	+ Subscription: `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}`
	+ Resource group: `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}`
	+ Resource: `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/{resourceProviderNamespace}/[{parentResourcePath}/]`

You're now ready to identify non-compliant resources to understand the compliance state of your
environment.

## Identify non-compliant resources

Now that your policy assignment is created, you can identify resources that aren't compliant.

1. Initialize a new .NET Core console application named "policyCompliance":

```
dotnet new console --name "policyCompliance"

```
2. Change directories into the new project folder and install the required packages for Azure
Policy:

```
# Add the Azure Policy package for .NET Core
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Management.PolicyInsights --version 3.1.0

# Add the Azure app auth package for .NET Core
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Services.AppAuthentication --version 1.5.0

```
3. Replace the default `program.cs` with the following code and save the updated file:

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory;
using Microsoft.Rest;
using Microsoft.Azure.Management.PolicyInsights;
using Microsoft.Azure.Management.PolicyInsights.Models;

namespace policyAssignment
{
    class Program
    {
        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            string strTenant = args[0];
            string strClientId = args[1];
            string strClientSecret = args[2];
            string strSubscriptionId = args[3];
            string strName = args[4];

            var authContext = new AuthenticationContext($"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{strTenant}");
            var authResult = await authContext.AcquireTokenAsync(
                "https://management.core.windows.net",
                new ClientCredential(strClientId, strClientSecret));

            using (var client = new PolicyInsightsClient(new TokenCredentials(authResult.AccessToken)))
            {
                var policyQueryOptions = new QueryOptions
                {
                    Filter = $"IsCompliant eq false and PolicyAssignmentId eq '{strName}'",
                    Apply = "groupby(ResourceId)"
                };

                var response = await client.PolicyStates.ListQueryResultsForSubscriptionAsync(
                    "latest", strSubscriptionId, policyQueryOptions);
                Console.WriteLine(response.Odatacount);
            }
        }
    }
}

```
4. Build and publish the `policyAssignment` console application:

```
dotnet build
dotnet publish -o {run-folder}

```
5. Change directories to the `{run-folder}` you defined with the previous `dotnet publish` command.
6. Enter the following command in the terminal:

```
policyCompliance.exe `
   "{tenantId}" `
   "{clientId}" `
   "{clientSecret}" `
   "{subscriptionId}" `
   "audit-vm-manageddisks"

```

The preceding commands use the following information:

* `{tenantId}` - Replace with your tenant ID
* `{clientId}` - Replace with the client ID of your service principal
* `{clientSecret}` - Replace with the client secret of your service principal
* `{subscriptionId}` - Replace with your subscription ID
* **name** - The unique name for the policy assignment object. The example above uses
*audit-vm-manageddisks*.

The results in `response` match what you see in the **Resource compliance** tab of a policy
assignment in the Azure portal view.

## Clean up resources

* Delete the policy assignment *Audit VMs without managed disks Assignment* through the portal. The
policy definition is a built-in, so there's no definition to remove.
* If you wish to remove the .NET Core console applications and installed packages, delete the
`policyAssignment` and `policyCompliance` project folders.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you assigned a policy definition to identify non-compliant resources in your
Azure environment.
