**Applies to:** âï¸ Linux VMs âï¸ Windows VMs âï¸ Flexible scale sets âï¸ Uniform scale sets

Performance expectations using common HPC microbenchmarks are as follows:

| Workload | HBv3 |
| --- | --- |
| STREAM Triad | 330-350 GB/s (amplified up to 630 GB/s) |
| High-Performance Linpack (HPL) | 4 TF (Rpeak, FP64), 8 TF (Rpeak, FP32) for 120-core VM size |
| RDMA latency & bandwidth | 1.2 microseconds (1 byte), 192 GB/s (one-way) |
| FIO on local NVMe SSDs (RAID0) | 7 GB/s reads, 3 GB/s writes; 186k IOPS reads, 201k IOPS writes |

## Process pinning

[Process pinning](compiling-scaling-applications#process-pinning) works well on HBv3-series VMs because we expose the underlying silicon as-is to the guest VM. We strongly recommend process pinning for optimal performance and consistency.

## MPI latency

The MPI latency test from the OSU microbenchmark suite can be executed as shown. Sample scripts are on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azhpc-images/blob/04ddb645314a6b2b02e9edb1ea52f079241f1297/tests/run-tests.sh).

```
./bin/mpirun_rsh -np 2 -hostfile ~/hostfile MV2_CPU_MAPPING=[INSERT CORE #] ./osu_latency

```

## MPI bandwidth

The MPI bandwidth test from the OSU microbenchmark suite can be executed per below. Sample scripts are on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azhpc-images/blob/04ddb645314a6b2b02e9edb1ea52f079241f1297/tests/run-tests.sh).

```
./mvapich2-2.3.install/bin/mpirun_rsh -np 2 -hostfile ~/hostfile MV2_CPU_MAPPING=[INSERT CORE #] ./mvapich2-2.3/osu_benchmarks/mpi/pt2pt/osu_bw

```

## Mellanox Perftest

The [Mellanox Perftest package](https://community.mellanox.com/s/article/perftest-package) has many InfiniBand tests such as latency (ib\_send\_lat) and bandwidth (ib\_send\_bw). An example command is below.

```
numactl --physcpubind=[INSERT CORE #]  ib_send_lat -a

```
