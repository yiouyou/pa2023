Azure virtual machines provide a fully configurable and flexible computing environment. This tutorial covers basic Azure virtual machine deployment items such as selecting a VM size, selecting a VM image, and deploying a VM. You learn how to:

* Create and connect to a VM
* Select and use VM images
* View and use specific VM sizes
* Resize a VM
* View and understand VM state

This tutorial uses the CLI within the [Azure Cloud Shell](../../cloud-shell/overview), which is constantly updated to the latest version.

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this tutorial requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.30 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Create resource group

Create a resource group with the [az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group) command.

An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. A resource group must be created before a virtual machine. In this example, a resource group named *myResourceGroupVM* is created in the *eastus2* region.

```
az group create --name myResourceGroupVM --location eastus2

```

The resource group is specified when creating or modifying a VM, which can be seen throughout this tutorial.

## Create virtual machine

Create a virtual machine with the [az vm create](/en-us/cli/azure/vm) command.

When you create a virtual machine, several options are available such as operating system image, disk sizing, and administrative credentials. The following example creates a VM named *myVM* that runs SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES). A user account named *azureuser* is created on the VM, and SSH keys are generated if they do not exist in the default key location (*~/.ssh*):

```
az vm create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroupVM \
    --name myVM \
    --image SLES \
    --public-ip-sku Standard \
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --generate-ssh-keys

```

It may take a few minutes to create the VM. Once the VM has been created, the Azure CLI outputs information about the VM. Take note of the `publicIpAddress`, this address can be used to access the virtual machine.

```
{
  "fqdns": "",
  "id": "/subscriptions/d5b9d4b7-6fc1-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupVM/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM",
  "location": "eastus2",
  "macAddress": "00-0D-3A-23-9A-49",
  "powerState": "VM running",
  "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.4",
  "publicIpAddress": "52.174.34.95",
  "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupVM"
}

```

## Connect to VM

You can now connect to the VM with SSH in the Azure Cloud Shell or from your local computer. Replace the example IP address with the `publicIpAddress` noted in the previous step.

```
ssh azureuser@52.174.34.95

```

Once logged in to the VM, you can install and configure applications. When you are finished, you close the SSH session as normal:

```
exit

```

## Understand VM images

The Azure Marketplace includes many images that can be used to create VMs. In the previous steps, a virtual machine was created using an Ubuntu image. In this step, the Azure CLI is used to search the marketplace for a CentOS image, which is then used to deploy a second virtual machine.

To see a list of the most commonly used images, use the [az vm image list](/en-us/cli/azure/vm/image) command.

```
az vm image list --output table

```

The command output returns the most popular VM images on Azure.

```

A full list can be seen by adding the `--all` parameter. The image list can also be filtered by `--publisher` or `â-offer`. In this example, the list is filtered for all images, published by OpenLogic, with an offer that matches *CentOS*.

```
az vm image list --offer CentOS --publisher OpenLogic --all --output table

```

Note

Canonical has changed the **Offer** names they use for the most recent versions. Before Ubuntu 20.04, the **Offer** name is UbuntuServer. For Ubuntu 20.04 the **Offer** name is `0001-com-ubuntu-server-focal` and for Ubuntu 22.04 it's `0001-com-ubuntu-server-jammy`.

To deploy a VM using a specific image, take note of the value in the *Urn* column, which consists of the publisher, offer, SKU, and optionally a version number to [identify](cli-ps-findimage#terminology) the image. When specifying the image, the image version number can be replaced with `latest`, which selects the latest version of the distribution. In this example, the `--image` parameter is used to specify the latest version of a CentOS 8.5.

```
az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroupVM --name myVM2 --image OpenLogic:CentOS:8_5:latest --generate-ssh-keys

```

## Understand VM sizes

A virtual machine size determines the amount of compute resources such as CPU, GPU, and memory that are made available to the virtual machine. Virtual machines need to be sized appropriately for the expected work load. If workload increases, an existing virtual machine can be resized.

### VM Sizes

The following table categorizes sizes into use cases.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [General purpose](../sizes-general) | Balanced CPU-to-memory. Ideal for dev / test and small to medium applications and data solutions. |
| [Compute optimized](../sizes-compute) | High CPU-to-memory. Good for medium traffic applications, network appliances, and batch processes. |
| [Memory optimized](../sizes-memory) | High memory-to-core. Great for relational databases, medium to large caches, and in-memory analytics. |
| [Storage optimized](../sizes-storage) | High disk throughput and IO. Ideal for Big Data, SQL, and NoSQL databases. |
| [GPU](../sizes-gpu) | Specialized VMs targeted for heavy graphic rendering and video editing. |
| [High performance](../sizes-hpc) | Our most powerful CPU VMs with optional high-throughput network interfaces (RDMA). |

### Find available VM sizes

To see a list of VM sizes available in a particular region, use the [az vm list-sizes](/en-us/cli/azure/vm) command.

```
az vm list-sizes --location eastus2 --output table

```

Example partial output:

```

### Create VM with specific size

In the previous VM creation example, a size was not provided, which results in a default size. A VM size can be selected at creation time using [az vm create](/en-us/cli/azure/vm) and the `--size` parameter.

```
az vm create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroupVM \
    --name myVM3 \
    --image SLES \
    --size Standard_D2ds_v4  \
    --generate-ssh-keys

```

### Resize a VM

After a VM has been deployed, it can be resized to increase or decrease resource allocation. You can view the current of size of a VM with [az vm show](/en-us/cli/azure/vm):

```
az vm show --resource-group myResourceGroupVM --name myVM --query hardwareProfile.vmSize

```

Before resizing a VM, check if the desired size is available on the current Azure cluster. The [az vm list-vm-resize-options](/en-us/cli/azure/vm) command returns the list of sizes.

```
az vm list-vm-resize-options --resource-group myResourceGroupVM --name myVM --query [].name

```

If the desired size is available, the VM can be resized from a powered-on state, however it is rebooted during the operation. Use the [az vm resize](/en-us/cli/azure/vm) command to perform the resize.

```
az vm resize --resource-group myResourceGroupVM --name myVM --size Standard_D4s_v3

```

If the desired size is not on the current cluster, the VM needs to be deallocated before the resize operation can occur. Use the [az vm deallocate](/en-us/cli/azure/vm) command to stop and deallocate the VM. Note, when the VM is powered back on, any data on the temp disk may be removed. The public IP address also changes unless a static IP address is being used.

```
az vm deallocate --resource-group myResourceGroupVM --name myVM

```

Once deallocated, the resize can occur.

```
az vm resize --resource-group myResourceGroupVM --name myVM --size Standard_GS1

```

After the resize, the VM can be started.

```
az vm start --resource-group myResourceGroupVM --name myVM

```

## VM power states

An Azure VM can have one of many power states. This state represents the current state of the VM from the standpoint of the hypervisor.

### Power states

| Power State | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Starting | Indicates the virtual machine is being started. |
| Running | Indicates that the virtual machine is running. |
| Stopping | Indicates that the virtual machine is being stopped. |
| Stopped | Indicates that the virtual machine is stopped. Virtual machines in the stopped state still incur compute charges. |
| Deallocating | Indicates that the virtual machine is being deallocated. |
| Deallocated | Indicates that the virtual machine is removed from the hypervisor but still available in the control plane. Virtual machines in the Deallocated state do not incur compute charges. |
| - | Indicates that the power state of the virtual machine is unknown. |

### Find the power state

To retrieve the state of a particular VM, use the [az vm get-instance-view](/en-us/cli/azure/vm) command. Be sure to specify a valid name for a virtual machine and resource group.

```
az vm get-instance-view \
    --name myVM \
    --resource-group myResourceGroupVM \
    --query instanceView.statuses[1] --output table

```

Output:

```
Code                Level    DisplayStatus
------------------  -------  ---------------
PowerState/running  Info     VM running

```

To retrieve the power state of all the VMs in your subscription, use the [Virtual Machines - List All API](/en-us/rest/api/compute/virtualmachines/listall) with parameter **statusOnly** set to *true*.

## Management tasks

During the life-cycle of a virtual machine, you may want to run management tasks such as starting, stopping, or deleting a virtual machine. Additionally, you may want to create scripts to automate repetitive or complex tasks. Using the Azure CLI, many common management tasks can be run from the command line or in scripts.

### Get IP address

This command returns the private and public IP addresses of a virtual machine.

```
az vm list-ip-addresses --resource-group myResourceGroupVM --name myVM --output table

```

### Stop virtual machine

```
az vm stop --resource-group myResourceGroupVM --name myVM

```

### Start virtual machine

```
az vm start --resource-group myResourceGroupVM --name myVM

```

### Deleting VM resources

Depending on how you delete a VM, it may only delete the VM resource, not the networking and disk resources. You can change the default behavior to delete other resources when you delete the VM. For more information, see [Delete a VM and attached resources](../delete).

Deleting a resource group also deletes all resources in the resource group, like the VM, virtual network, and disk. The `--no-wait` parameter returns control to the prompt without waiting for the operation to complete. The `--yes` parameter confirms that you wish to delete the resources without an additional prompt to do so.

```
az group delete --name myResourceGroupVM --no-wait --yes

```
