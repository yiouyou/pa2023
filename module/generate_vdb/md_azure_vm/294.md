You can create a remote desktop connection to a virtual machine (VM) running Windows in Azure.

To connect to a Windows VM from a Mac, you will need to install an RDP client for Mac such as [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://aka.ms/rdmac).

## Prerequisites

* In order to connect to a Windows Virtual Machine via RDP you need TCP connectivity to the machine on the port where Remote Desktop service is listening (3389 by default). You can validate an appropriate port is open for RDP using the troubleshooter or by checking manually in your VM settings. To check if the TCP port is open (assuming default):

	1. On the page for the VM, select **Networking** from the left menu.
	2. On the **Networking** page, check to see if there is a rule which allows TCP on port 3389 from the IP address of the computer you are using to connect to the VM. If the rule exists, you can move to the next section.
	3. If there isn't a rule, add one by selecting **Add Inbound port rule**.
	4. From the **Service** dropdown select **RDP**.
	5. Edit **Priority** and **Source** if necessary
	6. For **Name**, type *Port\_3389*
	7. When finished, select **Add**
	8. You should now have an RDP rule in the table of inbound port rules.
* Your VM must have a public IP address. To check if your VM has a public IP address, select **Overview** from the left menu and look at the **Networking** section. If you see an IP address next to **Public IP address**, then your VM has a public IP. To learn more about adding a public IP address to an existing VM, see [Associate a public IP address to a virtual machine](../../virtual-network/ip-services/associate-public-ip-address-vm)
* Verify your VM is running. On the Overview tab, in the essentials section, verify the status of the VM is Running. To start the VM, select **Start** at the top of the page.

## Connect to the virtual machine

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) to connect to a VM. Search for and select **Virtual machines**.
2. Select the virtual machine from the list.
3. At the beginning of the virtual machine page, select **Connect**.
4. On the **Connect to virtual machine** page, select **RDP**, and then select the appropriate **IP address** and **Port number**. In most cases, the default IP address and port should be used. Select **Download RDP File**. If the VM has a just-in-time policy set, you first need to select the **Request access** button to request access before you can download the RDP file. For more information about the just-in-time policy, see [Manage virtual machine access using the just in time policy](../../security-center/security-center-just-in-time).
5. Open the downloaded RDP file and select **Connect** when prompted. You will get a warning that the `.rdp` file is from an unknown publisher. This is expected. In the **Remote Desktop Connection** window, select **Connect** to continue.

6. In the **Windows Security** window, select **More choices** and then **Use a different account**. Enter the credentials for an account on the virtual machine and then select **OK**.

**Local account**: This is usually the local account user name and password that you specified when you created the virtual machine. In this case, the domain is the name of the virtual machine and it is entered as *vmname*\*username*.

**Domain joined VM**: If the VM belongs to a domain, enter the user name in the format *Domain*\*Username*. The account also needs to either be in the Administrators group or have been granted remote access privileges to the VM.

**Domain controller**: If the VM is a domain controller, enter the user name and password of a domain administrator account for that domain.
7. Select **Yes** to verify the identity of the virtual machine and finish logging on.

Tip

If the **Connect** button in the portal is grayed-out and you are not connected to Azure via an [Express Route](../../expressroute/expressroute-introduction) or [Site-to-Site VPN](../../vpn-gateway/tutorial-site-to-site-portal) connection, you will need to create and assign your VM a public IP address before you can use RDP. For more information, see [Public IP addresses in Azure](../../virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-addresses).

## Connect to the virtual machine using PowerShell

If you are using PowerShell and have the Azure PowerShell module installed you may also connect using the `Get-AzRemoteDesktopFile` cmdlet, as shown below.

This example will immediately launch the RDP connection, taking you through similar prompts as above.

```
Get-AzRemoteDesktopFile -ResourceGroupName "RgName" -Name "VmName" -Launch

```

You may also save the RDP file for future use.

```
Get-AzRemoteDesktopFile -ResourceGroupName "RgName" -Name "VmName" -LocalPath "C:\Path\to\folder"

```

## Next steps

If you have difficulty connecting, see [Troubleshoot Remote Desktop connections](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshoot-rdp-connection?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json).
