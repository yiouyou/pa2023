Tip

Try the **[Virtual Machine selector tool](https://aka.ms/vm-selector)** to find other sizes that best fit your workload.

This article provides answers to frequently asked questions (FAQ) about Azure VM sizes that don't have a local temporary disk (that is, no local temp disk).

## What does no local temp disk mean?

Traditionally, we have had VM sizes (for example, Standard\_D2s\_v3, Standard\_E48\_v3) that include a small local disk (that is, a D: Drive). With the VM series such as [Dasv5](dasv5-dadsv5-series) and [Easv5](easv5-eadsv5-series) that small local disk no longer exists. However, you can still attach Standard HDD, Premium SSD or Ultra SSD to use as remote storage.

## What if I still want a local temp disk?

If your workload requires a local temporary disk, we still offer sizes such as the [Dadsv5](dasv5-dadsv5-series).

Note

Local temporary disk isn't persistent; to ensure your data is persistent, please use Standard HDD, Premium SSD or Ultra SSD options.

## Can I resize a VM size that has a local temp disk to a VM size with no local temp disk?

No. The only combinations allowed for resizing are:

1. VM (with local temp disk) -> VM (with local temp disk); and
2. VM (with no local temp disk) -> VM (with no local temp disk).

If interested in a work around, please see next question.

Note

If an image depends on the resource disk, or a pagefile or swapfile exists on the local temp disk, the diskless images won't workâinstead, use the âwith diskâ alternative.

## How do I migrate from a VM size with local temp disk to a VM size with no local temp disk?

You can migrate by following these steps:

1. Connect to your Virtual Machine that has a local temporary disk (for example, a D: Drive) as a local admin.
2. Follow the guidelines on the "Temporarily move pagefile.sys to C drive" section of [Use the D: drive as a data drive on a Windows VM](windows/change-drive-letter) to move the page file from the local temporary disk (D: drive) to the C: drive.

Note

Follow the guidelines on the "Temporarily move pagefile.sys to C drive" section of Use the D: drive as a data drive on a Windows VM to move page file from the local temporary disk (D: drive) to C: drive. **Deviation from the steps outlined will lead to the error message - "Unable to resize the VM since changing from resource disk to non-resource disk VM size and vice-versa is not allowed.**
3. Take a snapshot of the VM by following the steps outlined in [Create a snapshot using the portal or Azure CLI](linux/snapshot-copy-managed-disk).
4. Use snapshot to create a new diskless VM (such as, Dv5, Dsv5, Dasv5, Ev5, Esv5, Easv5 series) by following the steps outlined in [Create a virtual machine from a snapshot with CLI](/en-us/previous-versions/azure/virtual-machines/scripts/virtual-machines-linux-cli-sample-create-vm-from-snapshot).

## Do these VM sizes support both Linux and Windows Operating Systems (OS)?

Yes.

## Will this break my custom scripts, custom images or OS images that have scratch files or page files on a local temp disk?

If the custom OS image points to the local temp disk, the image might not work correctly with this diskless size.
