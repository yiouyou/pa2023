## In this article

Managed identities for Azure resources is a feature of Azure Active Directory. Each of the [Azure services that support managed identities for Azure resources](services-support-managed-identities) are subject to their own timeline. Make sure you review the [availability](services-support-managed-identities) status of managed identities for your resource and [known issues](known-issues) before you begin.

Managed identities for Azure resources provide Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory (AD). You can use this identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, without having credentials in your code.

In this article, you learn how to enable and remove managed identities for Azure resources for an Azure VM, using an Azure SDK.

## Prerequisites

* If you're not familiar with the managed identities for Azure resources feature, see this <overview>. If you don't have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you continue.

## Azure SDKs with managed identities for Azure resources support

Azure supports multiple programming platforms through a series of [Azure SDKs](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads). Several of them have been updated to support managed identities for Azure resources, and provide corresponding samples to demonstrate usage. This list is updated as other support is added:

| SDK | Sample |
| --- | --- |
| .NET | [Manage resource from a VM enabled with managed identities for Azure resources enabled](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aad-dotnet-manage-resources-from-vm-with-msi) |
| Java | [Manage storage from a VM enabled with managed identities for Azure resources](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/compute-java-manage-resources-from-vm-with-msi-in-aad-group) |
| Node.js | [Create a VM with system-assigned managed identity enabled](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/compute-node-msi-vm/) |
| Python | [Create a VM with system-assigned managed identity enabled](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/compute-python-msi-vm/) |
| Ruby | [Create Azure VM with a system-assigned identity enabled](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/compute-ruby-msi-vm/) |
