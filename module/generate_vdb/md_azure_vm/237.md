## Updates

### April 2023

New portal functionality has been added for Azure Image Builder. Search âImage Templatesâ in Azure portal, then click âCreateâ. You can also [get started here](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.ImageTemplate) with building and validating custom images inside the portal.

## API releases

### Version 2022-07-01

**Changes**

* `replicationRegions` is now deprecated for gallery distributions. For more information, use [gallery-replicated-regions](/en-us/cli/azure/image/builder/output?view=azure-cli-latest#az-image-builder-output-add-examples&preserve-view=true)
* VHDs can now be distributed to a custom blob or container in a custom storage account

### Version 2021-10-01

**Breaking change**

API version 2021-10-01 introduces a change to the error schema that will be part of every future API release. If you have any Azure VM Image Builder automations, be aware of the [new error output](#error-output-for-version-2021-10-01-and-later) when you switch to API version 2021-10-01 or later. We recommend, after you've switched to the latest API version, that you don't revert to an earlier version, because you'll have to change your automation again to produce the earlier error schema. We don't anticipate that we'll change the error schema again in future releases.

##### **Error output for version 2020-02-14 and earlier**

```
{ 
  "code": "ValidationFailed",
  "message": "Validation failed: 'ImageTemplate.properties.source': Field 'imageId' has a bad value: '/subscriptions/subscriptionID/resourceGroups/resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/imageName'. Please review  http://aka.ms/azvmimagebuildertmplref  for details on fields requirements in the Image Builder Template." 
} 

```

##### **Error output for version 2021-10-01 and later**

    "code": "ValidationFailed", 
    "message": "Validation failed: 'ImageTemplate.properties.source': Field 'imageId' has a bad value: '/subscriptions/subscriptionID/resourceGroups/resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/imageName'. Please review  http://aka.ms/azvmimagebuildertmplref  for details on fields requirements in the Image Builder Template." 
  }
