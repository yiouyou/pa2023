The NP-series virtual machines are powered by [Xilinx U250](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u250.html) FPGAs for accelerating workloads including machine learning inference, video transcoding, and database search & analytics. NP-series VMs are also powered by Intel Xeon 8171M (Skylake) CPUs with all core turbo clock speed of 3.2 GHz.

## Size table definitions

* Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
* Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
* Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **ReadOnly** or **ReadWrite**. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **None**.
* To learn how to get the best storage performance for your VMs, see [Virtual machine and disk performance](disks-performance).
* **Expected network bandwidth** is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, see [Virtual machine network bandwidth](../virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput).

Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, see [Optimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines](../virtual-network/virtual-network-optimize-network-bandwidth). To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, see [Bandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP)](../virtual-network/virtual-network-bandwidth-testing).

## Frequently asked questions

**Q:** How to request quota for NP VMs?

**A:** Follow this page [Increase VM-family vCPU quotas](../azure-portal/supportability/per-vm-quota-requests). NP VMs are available in East US, West US2, West Europe, SouthEast Asia, and SouthCentral US.

**Q:** What version of Vitis should I use?

**A:** Xilinx recommends [Vitis 2022.1](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vitis/vitis-platform.html), you can also use the Development VM marketplace options (Vitis 2022.1 Development VM for Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04, and CentOS 7.8)

**Q:** Do I need to use NP VMs to develop my solution?

**Q:** What are the differences between on-premise FPGAs and NP VMs?

**A:**

**- Regarding XOCL/XCLMGMT:** 

On Azure NP VMs, only the role endpoint (Device ID 5005), which uses the XOCL driver, is present.

In on-premise FPGAs, both the management endpoint (Device ID 5004) and role endpoint (Device ID 5005), which use the XCLMGMT and XOCL drivers respectively, are present.

**- Regarding XRT:** 

On Azure NP VMs, the XDMA 2.1 platform only supports Host\_Mem(SB). 

To enable Host\_Mem(SB) (up to 1-Gb RAM): sudo xbutil host\_mem --enable --size 1g 

To disable Host\_Mem(SB): sudo xbutil host\_mem --disable 

Starting on XRT2021.1:
On-premise FPGA in Linux exposes
[M2M data transfer](https://xilinx.github.io/XRT/master/html/m2m.html).

This feature isn't supported in Azure NP VMs.

**Q:** Can I run xbmgmt commands?

**A:** No, on Azure VMs there's no management support directly from the Azure VM.

**Q:** Do I need to load a PLP?

**A:** No, the PLP is loaded automatically for you, so there's no need to load via xbmgmt commands.

**Q:** Does Azure support different PLPs?

**A:** Not at this time. We only support the PLP provided in the deployment platform packages.

**Q:** How can I query the PLP information?

**A:** Need to run xbutil query and look at the lower portion.

**Q:** Do Azure NP VMs support FPGA bitstreams with Networking GT Kernel connections?

**A:** No. The FPGA Attestation service performs a series of validations on a design checkpoint file and will generate an error if the user's application contains connections to the FPGA card's QSFP networking ports.
