This page outlines the naming conventions used for Azure VMs. VMs use these naming conventions to denote varying features and specifications.

## Naming convention explanation

**[Family]** + **[Sub-family*]*\* + **[# of vCPUs]** + **[Constrained vCPUs*]*\* + **[Additive Features]** + **[Accelerator Type*]*\* + **[Version]**

| Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Family | Indicates the VM Family Series |
| \*Subfamily | Used for specialized VM differentiations only |
| # of vCPUs | Denotes the number of vCPUs of the VM |
| \*Constrained vCPUs | Used for certain VM sizes only. Denotes the number of vCPUs for the [constrained vCPU capable size](constrained-vcpu) |
| Additive Features | Lower case letters denote additive features, such as:  a = AMD-based processor  b = Block Storage performance  d = diskful (that is, a local temp disk is present); this feature is for newer Azure VMs, see [Ddv4 and Ddsv4-series](ddv4-ddsv4-series)  i = isolated size  l = low memory; a lower amount of memory than the memory intensive size  m = memory intensive; the most amount of memory in a particular size p = ARM Cpu  t = tiny memory; the smallest amount of memory in a particular size  s = Premium Storage capable, including possible use of [Ultra SSD](disks-types#ultra-disks) (Note: some newer sizes without the attribute of s can still support Premium Storage, such as M128, M64, etc.) C = Confidential NP = node packing  |
| \*Accelerator Type | Denotes the type of hardware accelerator in the specialized/GPU SKUs. Only the new specialized/GPU SKUs launched from Q3 2020 have the hardware accelerator in the name. |
| Version | Denotes the version of the VM Family Series |

## Example breakdown

**[Family]** + **[Subfamily*]*\* + **[# of vCPUs]** + **[Additive Features]** + **[Accelerator Type*]*\* + **[Version]**

### Example 1: M416ms\_v2

| Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Family | M |
| # of vCPUs | 416 |
| Additive Features | m = memory intensive  s = Premium Storage capable |
| Version | v2 |

### Example 2: NV16as\_v4

| Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Family | N |
| Subfamily | V |
| # of vCPUs | 16 |
| Additive Features | a = AMD-based processor  s = Premium Storage capable |
| Version | v4 |

### Example 3: NC4as\_T4\_v3

| Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Family | N |
| Subfamily | C |
| # of vCPUs | 4 |
| Additive Features | a = AMD-based processor  s = Premium Storage capable |
| Accelerator Type | T4 |
| Version | v3 |

### Example 4: M8-2ms\_v2 (Constrained vCPU)

| Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Family | M |
| # of vCPUs | 8 |
| # of constrained (actual) vCPUs | 2 |
| Additive Features | m = memory intensive  s = Premium Storage capable |
| Version | v2 |
