## In this article

This quickstart shows you how to create a virtual network by using Azure CLI, the Azure command-line interface. You then create two virtual machines (VMs) in the network, securely connect to the VMs from the internet, and communicate privately between the VMs.

A virtual network is the fundamental building block for private networks in Azure. Azure Virtual Network enables Azure resources like VMs to securely communicate with each other and the internet.

If you don't have an [Azure subscription](../guides/developer/azure-developer-guide#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing), create an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

* Use the Bash environment in [Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see [Quickstart for Bash in Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).

[![](../reusable-content/azure-cli/media/hdi-launch-cloud-shell.png)](https://shell.azure.com)
* If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally, [install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see [How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).

	+ If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the [az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see [Sign in with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).
	+ When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see [Use extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).
	+ Run [az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version) to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run [az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).

## Create a resource group

1. Use [az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) to create a resource group to host the virtual network. Use the following code to create a resource group named **test-rg** in the **eastus2** Azure region.

```
az group create \
    --name test-rg \
    --location eastus2

```

## Create a virtual network and subnet

1. Use [az network vnet create](/en-us/cli/azure/network/vnet#az-network-vnet-create) to create a virtual network named **vnet-1** with a subnet named **subnet-1** in the **test-rg** resource group.

```
az network vnet create \
    --name vnet-1 \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 \
    --subnet-name subnet-1 \
    --subnet-prefixes 10.0.0.0/24

```

## Deploy Azure Bastion

Azure Bastion uses your browser to connect to VMs in your virtual network over secure shell (SSH) or remote desktop protocol (RDP) by using their private IP addresses. The VMs don't need public IP addresses, client software, or special configuration.

Hourly pricing starts from the moment Bastion is deployed, regardless of outbound data usage. For more information, see [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-bastion/) and [SKUs](../bastion/configuration-settings#skus). If you're deploying Bastion as part of a tutorial or test, we recommend that you delete this resource once you've finished using it. For more information about Azure Bastion, see [Azure Bastion](../bastion/bastion-overview).

1. Use [az network vnet subnet create](/en-us/cli/azure/network/vnet/subnet#az-network-vnet-subnet-create) to create an Azure Bastion subnet for your virtual network. This subnet is reserved exclusively for Azure Bastion resources and must be named **AzureBastionSubnet**.

```
az network vnet subnet create \
    --name AzureBastionSubnet \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --vnet-name vnet-1 \
    --address-prefix 10.0.1.0/26

```
2. Create a public IP address for Azure Bastion. This IP address is used to connect to the Bastion host from the internet. Use [az network public-ip create](/en-us/cli/azure/network/public-ip#az-network-public-ip-create) to create a public IP address named **public-ip** in the **test-rg** resource group.

```
az network public-ip create \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --name public-ip \
    --sku Standard \
    --location eastus2 \
    --zone 1 2 3

```
3. Use [az network bastion create](/en-us/cli/azure/network/bastion#az-network-bastion-create) to create an Azure Bastion host in the AzureBastionSubnet of your virtual network.

```
az network bastion create \
    --name bastion \
    --public-ip-address public-ip \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --vnet-name vnet-1 \
    --location eastus2

```

It takes about 10 minutes for the Bastion resources to deploy. You can create VMs in the next section while Bastion deploys to your virtual network.

## Create virtual machines

Use [az vm create](/en-us/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-create) to create two VMs named **VM1** and **VM2** in the **subnet-1** subnet of the virtual network. When you're prompted for credentials, enter user names and passwords for the VMs.

1. To create the first VM, use the following command:

```
az vm create \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --authentication-type password \
    --name vm-1 \
    --image Ubuntu2204 \
    --public-ip-address ""

```
2. To create the second VM, use the following command:

```
az vm create \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --authentication-type password \
    --name vm-2 \
    --image Ubuntu2204 \
    --public-ip-address ""

```

Tip

You can also use the `--no-wait` option to create a VM in the background while you continue with other tasks.

The VMs take a few minutes to create. After Azure creates each VM, Azure CLI returns output similar to the following message:

```
    {
      "fqdns": "",
      "id": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/test-rg/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/vm-2",
      "location": "eastus2",
      "macAddress": "00-0D-3A-23-9A-49",
      "powerState": "VM running",
      "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.5",
      "publicIpAddress": "",
      "resourceGroup": "test-rg"
      "zones": ""
    }

```

Note

VMs in a virtual network with a Bastion host don't need public IP addresses. Bastion provides the public IP, and the VMs use private IPs to communicate within the network. You can remove the public IPs from any VMs in Bastion-hosted virtual networks. For more information, see [Dissociate a public IP address from an Azure VM](ip-services/remove-public-ip-address-vm).

Note

Azure provides a default outbound access IP for VMs that either aren't assigned a public IP address or are in the back-end pool of an internal basic Azure load balancer. The default outbound access IP mechanism provides an outbound IP address that isn't configurable.

The default outbound access IP is disabled when a public IP address is assigned to the VM, the VM is placed in the back-end pool of a standard load balancer, with or without outbound rules, or if an [Azure Virtual Network NAT gateway](nat-gateway/nat-overview) resource is assigned to the subnet of the VM.

VMs that are created by virtual machine scale sets in flexible orchestration mode don't have default outbound access.

For more information about outbound connections in Azure, see [Default outbound access in Azure](ip-services/default-outbound-access) and [Use source network address translation (SNAT) for outbound connections](../load-balancer/load-balancer-outbound-connections).

## Connect to a virtual machine

1. In the portal, search for and select **Virtual machines**.
2. On the **Virtual machines** page, select **vm-1**.
3. In the **Overview** of **vm-1**, select **Connect**.
4. In the **Connect to virtual machine** page, select the **Bastion** tab.
5. Select **Use Bastion**.
6. Enter the username and password you created when you created the VM, and then select **Connect**.

## Communicate between VMs

1. At the bash prompt for **vm-1**, enter `ping -c 4 vm-2`.

You get a reply similar to the following message:

```
azureuser@vm-1:~$ ping -c 4 vm-2
PING vm-2.3bnkevn3313ujpr5l1kqop4n4d.cx.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.5) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from vm-2.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.5): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.83 ms
64 bytes from vm-2.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.5): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.987 ms
64 bytes from vm-2.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.5): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.864 ms
64 bytes from vm-2.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.5): icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.890 ms

```
2. Close the Bastion connection to VM1.
3. Repeat the steps in [Connect to a virtual machine](#connect-to-a-virtual-machine) to connect to VM2.
4. At the bash prompt for **vm-2**, enter `ping -c 4 vm-1`.

You get a reply similar to the following message:

```
azureuser@vm-2:~$ ping -c 4 vm-1
PING vm-1.3bnkevn3313ujpr5l1kqop4n4d.cx.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.4) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from vm-1.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.4): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.695 ms
64 bytes from vm-1.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.4): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.896 ms
64 bytes from vm-1.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.4): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=3.43 ms
64 bytes from vm-1.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.4): icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.780 ms

```
5. Close the Bastion connection to VM2.

## Clean up resources

When you're done with the virtual network and the VMs, use [az group delete](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) to remove the resource group and all its resources.

```
az group delete \
    --name test-rg \
    --yes

```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created a virtual network with a default subnet that contains two VMs. You deployed Azure Bastion and used it to connect to the VMs, and securely communicated between the VMs. To learn more about virtual network settings, see [Create, change, or delete a virtual network](manage-virtual-network).

Private communication between VMs in a virtual network is unrestricted by default. Continue to the next article to learn more about configuring different types of VM network communications.
