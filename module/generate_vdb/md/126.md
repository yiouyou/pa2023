## In this article

Based on feedback weâve received from customers weâre happy to announce that we are extending the retirement date by 1 year to August 31, 2023, for the Azure NV-Series and NV\_Promo Series virtual machine to give you more time to plan your migration.

We continue to bring modern and optimized virtual machine (VM) instances to Azure by using the latest innovations in datacenter technologies. As we innovate, we also thoughtfully plan how we retire aging hardware. With this context in mind, we're retiring our NV-series Azure VM sizes on August 31, 2023.

## How does the NV series migration affect me?

After August 31, 2023, any remaining NV and NV\_Promo-size VMs remaining in your subscription will be set to a deallocated state. These VMs will be stopped and removed from the host. These VMs will no longer be billed in the deallocated state.

The current VM size retirement only affects the VM sizes in the [NV series](nv-series). This retirement doesn't affect the [NVv3](nvv3-series) and [NVv4](nvv4-series) series VMs.

## What actions should I take?

You'll need to resize or deallocate your NV VMs. We recommend moving your GPU visualizations or graphics workloads to another [GPU accelerated VM size](sizes-gpu).
