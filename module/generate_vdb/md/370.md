To get VMs as close as possible, achieving the lowest possible latency, you should deploy them within a [proximity placement group](../co-location#proximity-placement-groups).

A proximity placement group is a logical grouping used to make sure that Azure compute resources are physically located close to each other. Proximity placement groups are useful for workloads where low latency is a requirement.

## Create the proximity placement group

Create a proximity placement group using [`az ppg create`](/en-us/cli/azure/ppg#az-ppg-create).

```
az group create --name myPPGGroup --location eastus
az ppg create \
   -n myPPG \
   -g myPPGGroup \
   -l eastus \
   -t standard \
   --intent-vm-sizes Standard_E64s_v4 Standard_M416ms_v2 \
   -z 1

```

## List proximity placement groups

You can list all of your proximity placement groups using ['az ppg list'](/en-us/cli/azure/ppg#az-ppg-list).

```
az ppg list -o table

```

## Show proximity placement group

You can see the proximity placement group details and resources using ['az ppg show'](/en-us/cli/azure/ppg#az-ppg-show)

```
az ppg show --name myPPG --resource-group myPPGGroup
{Â Â "availabilitySets": [],Â Â 
   "colocationStatus": null,Â Â 
   "id": "/subscriptions/[subscriptionId]/resourceGroups/myPPGGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/proximityPlacementGroups/MyPPG",Â Â 
   "intent": {Â Â Â Â 
    "vmSizes": [Â Â Â Â Â Â 
      "Standard_E64s_v4",Â Â Â Â Â Â 
      "Standard_M416ms_v2"Â Â Â Â 
    ]Â Â 
   },Â Â 
   "location": "eastus",Â Â 
   "name": "MyPPG",Â Â 
   "proximityPlacementGroupType": "Standard",Â Â 
   "resourceGroup": "myPPGGroup",Â Â 
   "tags": {},Â Â 
   "type": "Microsoft.Compute/proximityPlacementGroups",Â Â 
   "virtualMachineScaleSets": [],Â Â 
   "virtualMachines": [],Â Â 
   "zones": [Â Â Â Â 
    "1"Â 
   ]
}

```

## Create a VM

Create a VM within the proximity placement group using [new az vm](/en-us/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-create).

```
az vm create \
   -n myVM \
   -g myPPGGroup \
   --image UbuntuLTS \
   --ppg myPPG  \
   --generate-ssh-keys \
   --size Standard_E64s_v4 \
   -l eastus

```

You can see the VM in the proximity placement group using ['az ppg show'](/en-us/cli/azure/ppg#az-ppg-show).

```
az ppg show --name myppg --resource-group myppggroup --query "virtualMachines"

```

## Availability Sets

You can also create an availability set in your proximity placement group. Use the same `--ppg` parameter with [az vm availability-set create](/en-us/cli/azure/vm/availability-set#az-vm-availability-set-create) to add all VMs in the availability set to the same proximity placement group.

## Scale sets

You can also create a scale set in your proximity placement group. Use the same `--ppg` parameter with ['az vmss create'](/en-us/cli/azure/vmss#az-vmss-create) to create a scale set and all of the instances will be created in the same proximity placement group.
