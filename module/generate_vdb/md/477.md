## In this article

This script creates a snapshot from a VHD file in a storage account in same or different subscription. Use this script to import a specialized (not generalized/sysprepped) VHD to a snapshot and then use the snapshot to create multiple identical managed disks in small amount of time. Also, use it to import a data VHD to a snapshot and then use the snapshot to create multiple managed disks in small amount of time.

If you don't have an [Azure subscription](../../guides/developer/azure-developer-guide#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing), create an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.

## Sample script

```
#Provide the subscription Id where snapshot will be created
$subscriptionId = 'yourSubscriptionId'

#Provide the name of your resource group where snapshot will be created. 
$resourceGroupName ='yourResourceGroupName'

#Provide the name of the snapshot
$snapshotName = 'yourSnapshotName'

#Provide the storage type for snapshot. PremiumLRS or StandardLRS.
$storageType = 'StandardLRS'

#Provide the Azure region (e.g. westus) where snapshot will be located.
#This location should be same as the storage account location where VHD file is stored 
#Get all the Azure location using command below:
#Get-AzLocation
$location = 'westus'

#Provide the URI of the VHD file (page blob) in a storage account. Please not that this is NOT the SAS URI of the storage container where VHD file is stored. 
#e.g. https://contosostorageaccount1.blob.core.windows.net/vhds/contosovhd123.vhd
#Note: VHD file can be deleted as soon as Managed Disk is created.
$sourceVHDURI = 'https://yourStorageAccountName.blob.core.windows.net/vhds/yourVHDName.vhd'

#Provide the resource Id of the storage account where VHD file is stored. 
#e.g. /subscriptions/6582b1g7-e212-446b-b509-314e17e1efb0/resourceGroups/MDDemo/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/contosostorageaccount1
#This is an optional parameter if you are creating snapshot in the same subscription
$storageAccountId = '/subscriptions/yourSubscriptionId/resourceGroups/yourResourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/yourStorageAccountName'

#Set the context to the subscription Id where Managed Disk will be created
Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId

$snapshotConfig = New-AzSnapshotConfig -AccountType $storageType -Location $location -CreateOption Import -StorageAccountId $storageAccountId -SourceUri $sourceVHDURI 

New-AzSnapshot -Snapshot $snapshotConfig -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -SnapshotName $snapshotName

```
