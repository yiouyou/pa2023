[Regulatory Compliance in Azure Policy](../governance/policy/concepts/regulatory-compliance)
provides initiative definitions, known as *built-ins*, for the compliance domains and security controls related to different compliance standards. Microsoft creates and manages these built-ins.

In this article, you can refer to a list of the compliance domains and security controls for Azure VM Image Builder. You can assign the built-ins for a security control individually, to help make your Azure resources compliant with the specific standard.

The title of each built-in policy definition links to the policy definition in the Azure portal. Use the link in the **Policy Version** column to view the source on the
[Azure Policy GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy).

Important

Each control is associated with one or more [Azure Policy](../governance/policy/overview) definitions. These policies might help you [assess compliance](../governance/policy/how-to/get-compliance-data) with the control.
However, there often isn't a one-to-one or complete match between a control and one or more policies. As such, **Compliant** in Azure Policy refers only to the policies themselves. This doesn't ensure that you're fully compliant with all requirements of a control. In addition, the compliance standard includes controls that aren't addressed by any Azure Policy definitions at this time.
Therefore, compliance in Azure Policy is only a partial view of your overall compliance status. The associations between controls and Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance definitions for these compliance standards can change over time.
