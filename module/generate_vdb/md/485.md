When you no longer need a data disk that's attached to a virtual machine, you can easily detach it. This removes the disk from the virtual machine, but doesn't remove it from storage. In this article, we are working with an Ubuntu LTS 16.04 distribution. If you are using a different distribution, the instructions for unmounting the disk might be different.

Warning

If you detach a disk it is not automatically deleted. If you have subscribed to Premium storage, you will continue to incur storage charges for the disk. For more information, see [Pricing and Billing when using Premium Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/page-blobs/).

If you want to use the existing data on the disk again, you can reattach it to the same virtual machine, or another one.

## Connect to the VM to unmount the disk

Before you can detach the disk using either CLI or the portal, you need to unmount the disk and removed references to if from your fstab file.

Connect to the VM. In this example, the public IP address of the VM is *10.0.1.4* with the username *azureuser*:

```
ssh azureuser@10.0.1.4

```

First, find the data disk that you want to detach. The following example uses dmesg to filter on SCSI disks:

```
dmesg | grep SCSI

```

The output is similar to the following example:

```
[    0.294784] SCSI subsystem initialized
[    0.573458] Block layer SCSI generic (bsg) driver version 0.4 loaded (major 252)
[    7.110271] sd 2:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI disk
[    8.079653] sd 3:0:1:0: [sdb] Attached SCSI disk
[ 1828.162306] sd 5:0:0:0: [sdc] Attached SCSI disk

```

Here, *sdc* is the disk that we want to detach. You also should grab the UUID of the disk.

```
sudo -i blkid

```

The output looks similar to the following example:

```
/dev/sda1: UUID="11111111-1b1b-1c1c-1d1d-1e1e1e1e1e1e" TYPE="ext4"
/dev/sdb1: UUID="22222222-2b2b-2c2c-2d2d-2e2e2e2e2e2e" TYPE="ext4"
/dev/sdc1: UUID="33333333-3b3b-3c3c-3d3d-3e3e3e3e3e3e" TYPE="ext4"

```

Edit the */etc/fstab* file to remove references to the disk.

Note

Improperly editing the **/etc/fstab** file could result in an unbootable system. If unsure, refer to the distribution's documentation for information on how to properly edit this file. It is also recommended that a backup of the /etc/fstab file is created before editing.

Open the **/etc/fstab** file in a text editor and remove the line containing the UUID of your disk. Using the example values in this article, the line would look like the following:

```
UUID=33333333-3b3b-3c3c-3d3d-3e3e3e3e3e3e   /datadrive   ext4   defaults,nofail   1   2

```

Save and close the file when you're done.

Next, use `umount` to unmount the disk. The following example unmounts the */dev/sdc1* partition from the */datadrive* mount point:

```
sudo umount /dev/sdc1 /datadrive

```

## Detach a data disk using Azure CLI

This example detaches the *myDataDisk* disk from VM named *myVM* in *myResourceGroup*.

```
az vm disk detach -g myResourceGroup --vm-name myVm -n myDataDisk

```

The disk stays in storage but is no longer attached to a virtual machine.

### Lower latency

In select regions, the disk detach latency has been reduced, so you'll see an improvement of up to 15%. This is useful if you have planned/unplanned failovers between VMs, you're scaling your workload, or are running a high scale stateful workload such as Azure Kubernetes Service. However, this improvement is limited to the explicit disk detach command, `az vm disk detach`. You won't see the performance improvement if you call a command that may implicitly perform a detach, like `az vm update`. You don't need to take any action other than calling the explicit detach command to see this improvement.

Lower latency is currently available in every public region except for:

* Canada Central
* Central US
* East US
* East US 2
* South Central US
* West US 2
* Germany North
* Jio India West
* North Europe
* West Europe

## Detach a data disk using the portal

1. In the left menu, select **Virtual Machines**.
2. In the virtual machine blade, select **Disks**.
3. In the **Disks** blade, to the far right of the data disk that you would like to detach, select the **X** button, to detach the disk.
4. After the disk has been removed, select **Save** on the top of the blade.

The disk stays in storage but is no longer attached to a virtual machine. The disk is not deleted.

## Next steps

If you want to reuse the data disk, you can just [attach it to another VM](add-disk).

If you want to delete the disk, so that you no longer incur storage costs, see [Find and delete unattached Azure managed and unmanaged disks - Azure portal](../disks-find-unattached-portal).
