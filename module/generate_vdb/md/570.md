In the Azure Resource Manager stack, secrets/certificates are modeled as resources that are provided by Key Vault. To learn more about Azure Key Vault, see [What is Azure Key Vault?](../../key-vault/general/overview) In order for Key Vault to be used with Azure Resource Manager VMs, the *EnabledForDeployment* property on Key Vault must be set to true. This article shows you how to set up Key Vault for use with Azure virtual machines (VMs) using the Azure CLI.

To perform these steps, you need the latest [Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-az-cli2) installed and logged in to an Azure account using [az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index).

## Create a Key Vault

Create a key vault and assign the deployment policy with [az keyvault create](/en-us/cli/azure/keyvault). The following example creates a key vault named `myKeyVault` in the `myResourceGroup` resource group:

```
az keyvault create -l westus -n myKeyVault -g myResourceGroup --enabled-for-deployment true

```

## Update a Key Vault for use with VMs

Set the deployment policy on an existing key vault with [az keyvault update](/en-us/cli/azure/keyvault). The following updates the key vault named `myKeyVault` in the `myResourceGroup` resource group:

```
az keyvault update -n myKeyVault -g myResourceGroup --set properties.enabledForDeployment=true

```

## Use templates to set up Key Vault

When you use a template, you need to set the `enabledForDeployment` property to `true` for the Key Vault resource as follows:

```
{
    "type": "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults",
    "name": "ContosoKeyVault",
    "apiVersion": "2015-06-01",
    "location": "<location-of-key-vault>",
    "properties": {
    "enabledForDeployment": "true",
    ....
    ....
    }
}

```
