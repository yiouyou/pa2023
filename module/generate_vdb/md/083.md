The Eav4-series and Easv4-series run on 2nd Generation AMD EPYCTM 7452 or 3rd Generation EPYCTM 7763v processors in a multi-threaded configuration. The Eav4-series and Easv4-series have the same memory and disk configurations as the Ev3 & Esv3-series.

## Eav4-series

[Premium Storage](premium-storage-performance): Not Supported  

[Premium Storage caching](premium-storage-performance): Not Supported  

[Live Migration](maintenance-and-updates): Supported  

[Memory Preserving Updates](maintenance-and-updates): Supported  

[VM Generation Support](generation-2): Generations 1 and 2  

[Accelerated Networking](../virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-cli): Supported   

[Ephemeral OS Disks](ephemeral-os-disks): Supported   

[Nested Virtualization](/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/nested-virtualization): Not Supported   

The Eav4-series run on 2nd Generation AMD EPYCTM 7452 (up to 3.35GHz) or 3rd Generation EPYCTM 7763v processors (up to 3.5GHz). The Eav4-series sizes are ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications. Data disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. To use premium SSD, use the Easv4-series sizes. The pricing and billing meters for Easv4 sizes are the same as the Eav3-series.

1 Easv4-series VMs can [burst](disk-bursting) their disk performance and get up to their bursting max for up to 30 minutes at a time.   

2 [Constrained core sizes available](constrained-vcpu).   

3 Accelerated networking can only be applied to a single NIC.

## Size table definitions

* Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
* Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
* Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **ReadOnly** or **ReadWrite**. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **None**.
* To learn how to get the best storage performance for your VMs, see [Virtual machine and disk performance](disks-performance).
* **Expected network bandwidth** is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, see [Virtual machine network bandwidth](../virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput).

Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, see [Optimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines](../virtual-network/virtual-network-optimize-network-bandwidth). To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, see [Bandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP)](../virtual-network/virtual-network-bandwidth-testing).
