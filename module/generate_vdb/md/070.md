The Dv5 and Dsv5-series virtual machines run on the 3rd Generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor in a [hyper threaded](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html) configuration, providing a better value proposition for most general-purpose workloads. This new processor features an all core turbo clock speed of 3.5 GHz with [IntelÂ® Turbo Boost Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [IntelÂ® Advanced-Vector Extensions 512 (IntelÂ® AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html) and [IntelÂ® Deep Learning Boost](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai/deep-learning-boost.html). These virtual machines offer a combination of vCPUs and memory to meet the requirements associated with most enterprise workloads, such as small-to-medium databases, low-to-medium traffic web servers, application servers and more. The Dv5 and Dsv5-series provide a better value proposition for workloads that don't require local temp disk. For information about similar virtual machines with local disk, see [Ddv5 and Ddsv5-series VMs](ddv5-ddsv5-series).

Note

For frequently asked questions, see [Azure VM sizes with no local temp disk](azure-vms-no-temp-disk).

## Dv5-series

Dv5-series virtual machines run on the 3rd Generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor reaching an all core turbo clock speed of up to 3.5 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 96 vCPU and 384 GiB of RAM. Dv5-series virtual machines provide a better value proposition for most general-purpose workloads compared to the prior generation (for example, increased scalability and an upgraded CPU class).

Dv5-series virtual machines do not have any temporary storage thus lowering the price of entry. You can attach Standard SSDs, and Standard HDDs disk storage to these virtual machines. To use Premium SSD or Ultra Disk storage, select Dsv5-series virtual machines. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. [See pricing for disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/).

## Dsv5-series

Dsv5-series virtual machines run on the 3rd Generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor reaching an all core turbo clock speed of up to 3.5 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 96 vCPU and 384 GiB of RAM. Dsv5-series virtual machines provide a better value proposition for most general-purpose workloads compared to the prior generation (for example, increased scalability and an upgraded CPU class).

Dsv5-series virtual machines do not have any temporary storage thus lowering the price of entry. You can attach Standard SSDs, Standard HDDs, and Premium SSDs disk storage to these virtual machines. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.

## Size table definitions

* Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
* Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
* Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **ReadOnly** or **ReadWrite**. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **None**.
* To learn how to get the best storage performance for your VMs, see [Virtual machine and disk performance](disks-performance).
* **Expected network bandwidth** is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, see [Virtual machine network bandwidth](../virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput).

Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, see [Optimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines](../virtual-network/virtual-network-optimize-network-bandwidth). To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, see [Bandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP)](../virtual-network/virtual-network-bandwidth-testing).
