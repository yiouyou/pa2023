The Epsv5-series and Epdsv5-series virtual machines are based on the Arm architecture, delivering outstanding price-performance for memory-intensive workloads. These virtual machines feature the AmpereÂ® AltraÂ® Arm-based processor operating at 3.0 GHz, which provides an entire physical core for each virtual machine vCPU. These virtual machines offer a range of vCPU sizes, up to 8 GiB of memory per vCPU, and are best suited for memory-intensive scale-out and enterprise workloads, such as relational database servers, large databases, data analytics engines, in-memory caches, and more.

## Epsv5-series

Epsv5-series virtual machines feature the AmpereÂ® AltraÂ® Arm-based processor operating at 3.0 GHz, which provides an entire physical core for each virtual machine vCPU. These virtual machines offer up to 32 vCPU and 208 GiB of RAM and are ideal for memory-intensive scale-out and most Enterprise workloads. Epsv5-series virtual machines support Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types with no local-SSD support. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. [See pricing for disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/).

Accelerated networking is required and turned on by default on all Epsv5 machines.

## Epdsv5-series

Epdsv5-series virtual machines feature the AmpereÂ® AltraÂ® Arm-based processor operating at 3.0 GHz, which provides an entire physical core for each virtual machine vCPU. These virtual machines offer up to 32 vCPU, 208 GiB of RAM, and fast local SSD storage up to 1,200 GiB and are ideal for memory-intensive scale-out and most Enterprise workloads. Epdsv5-series virtual machines support Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. [See pricing for disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/).

## Size table definitions

* Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
* Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
* Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **ReadOnly** or **ReadWrite**. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **None**.
* To learn how to get the best storage performance for your VMs, see [Virtual machine and disk performance](disks-performance).
* **Expected network bandwidth** is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, see [Virtual machine network bandwidth](../virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput).

Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, see [Optimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines](../virtual-network/virtual-network-optimize-network-bandwidth). To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, see [Bandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP)](../virtual-network/virtual-network-bandwidth-testing).
