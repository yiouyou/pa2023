Several performance tests have been run on HB-series sizes. The following are some of the results of this performance testing.

| Workload | HB |
| --- | --- |
| STREAM Triad | 260 GB/s (32-33 GB/s per CCX) |
| High-Performance Linpack (HPL) | 1,000 GigaFLOPS (Rpeak), 860 GigaFLOPS (Rmax) |
| RDMA latency & bandwidth | 1.27 microseconds, 99.1 Gb/s |
| FIO on local NVMe SSD | 1.7 GB/s reads, 1.0 GB/s writes |
| IOR on 4 \* Azure Premium SSD (P30 Managed Disks, RAID0)\*\* | 725 MB/s reads, 780 MB/writes |

## MPI latency

MPI latency test from the OSU microbenchmark suite is run. Sample scripts are on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azhpc-images/blob/04ddb645314a6b2b02e9edb1ea52f079241f1297/tests/run-tests.sh)

```
./bin/mpirun_rsh -np 2 -hostfile ~/hostfile MV2_CPU_MAPPING=[INSERT CORE #] ./osu_latency 

```

## MPI bandwidth

MPI bandwidth test from the OSU microbenchmark suite is run. Sample scripts are on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azhpc-images/blob/04ddb645314a6b2b02e9edb1ea52f079241f1297/tests/run-tests.sh)

```
./mvapich2-2.3.install/bin/mpirun_rsh -np 2 -hostfile ~/hostfile MV2_CPU_MAPPING=[INSERT CORE #] ./mvapich2-2.3/osu_benchmarks/mpi/pt2pt/osu_bw

```

## Mellanox Perftest

The [Mellanox Perftest package](https://community.mellanox.com/s/article/perftest-package) has many InfiniBand tests such as latency (ib\_send\_lat) and bandwidth (ib\_send\_bw). An example command is below.

```
numactl --physcpubind=[INSERT CORE #]  ib_send_lat -a

```
