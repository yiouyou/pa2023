Today, about 90% of IaaS VMs are using [Azure Resource Manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/resource-manager/). As of February 28, 2020, classic VMs have been deprecated and will be fully retired on September 1, 2023. [Learn more](https://aka.ms/classicvmretirement) about this deprecation and [how it affects you](classic-vm-deprecation#how-does-this-affect-me).

This article catalogs the tools that have been provided by the community to assist with migration of IaaS resources from classic to the Azure Resource Manager deployment model.

These tools are not officially supported by Microsoft Support. Therefore they are open sourced on GitHub and we're happy to accept PRs for fixes or additional scenarios. To report an issue, use the GitHub issues feature.
