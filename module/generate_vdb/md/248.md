## In this article

Azure Dedicated Host SKUs are the combination of a VM family and a certain hardware specification. You can only deploy VMs of the VM series that the Dedicated Host SKU specifies. For example, on the Dsv3-Type3, you can only provision [Dsv3-series](dv3-dsv3-series#dsv3-series) VMs.

This document goes through the hardware specifications and VM packings for all memory optimized Dedicated Host SKUs.

## Limitations

The sizes and hardware types available for dedicated hosts vary by region. Refer to the host [pricing page](https://aka.ms/ADHPricing) to learn more.
