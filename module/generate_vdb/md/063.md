The DCsv2-series virtual machines help protect the confidentiality and integrity of your data and code while itâs processed in the public cloud. DCsv2-series leverage IntelÂ® Software Guard Extensions, which enable customers to use secure enclaves for protection.

These machines are backed by 3.7 GHz IntelÂ® Xeon E-2288G (Coffee Lake) with SGX technology. With IntelÂ® Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 these machines can go up to 5.0 GHz.

Note

Hyperthreading is disabled for added security posture. Pricing is the same as Dv5 and Dsv5-series per physical core.

Example confidential use cases include: databases, blockchain, multiparty data analytics, fraud detection, anti-money laundering, usage analytics, intelligence analysis and machine learning.
