## In this article

You can create virtual machine restore points through the Azure portal. You can protect your data and guard against extended downtime by creating [VM restore points](virtual-machines-create-restore-points#about-vm-restore-points) at regular intervals. This article shows you how to create VM restore points using the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can create VM restore points using the [Azure CLI](virtual-machines-create-restore-points-cli) or using [PowerShell](virtual-machines-create-restore-points-powershell).

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

* [Create a VM restore point collection](#step-1-create-a-vm-restore-point-collection)
* [Create a VM restore point](#step-2-create-a-vm-restore-point)
* [Track the progress of Copy operation](#step-3-track-the-status-of-the-vm-restore-point-creation)
* [Restore a VM](#restore-a-vm-from-a-restore-point)

## Prerequisites

* Learn more about the [support requirements](concepts-restore-points) and [limitations](virtual-machines-create-restore-points#limitations) before creating a restore point.

## Step 1: Create a VM restore point collection

Use the following steps to create a VM restore points collection:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. In the Search box, enter **Restore Point Collections**.

## Step 2: Create a VM restore point

Use the following steps to create a VM restore point:

1. Navigate to the restore point collection where you want to create restore points and select **+ Create a restore point** to create new restore point for the VM.

## Step 3: Track the status of the VM restore point creation

1. Select the notification to track the progress of the restore point creation.

## Restore a VM from a restore point

To restore a VM from a VM restore point, first restore individual disks from each disk restore point. You can also use the [ARM template](https://github.com/Azure/Virtual-Machine-Restore-Points/blob/main/RestoreVMFromRestorePoint.json) to restore a VM along with all the disks.

1. Select **Create a disk from a restore point** to restore a disk from a disk restore point. Do this for all the disks that you want to restore.

2. Enter the details in the **Create a managed disk** dialog to create disks from the restore points.
Once the disks are created, [create a new VM](windows/create-vm-specialized-portal#create-a-vm-from-a-disk) and [attach these restored disks](windows/attach-managed-disk-portal) to the newly created VM.
