Storage optimized virtual machine (VM) sizes offer high disk throughput and IO, and are ideal for Big Data, SQL, NoSQL databases, data warehousing, and large transactional databases. Examples include Cassandra, MongoDB, Cloudera, and Redis. This article provides information about the number of vCPUs, data disks, NICs, local storage throughput, and network bandwidth for each optimized size.

Tip

Try the [virtual machines selector tool](https://aka.ms/vm-selector) to find other sizes that best fit your workload.

The Lsv3, Lasv3, and Lsv2-series feature high-throughput, low latency, directly mapped local NVMe storage. These VM series come in sizes from 8 to 80 vCPU. There are 8 GiB of memory per vCPU, and one 1.92TB NVMe SSD device per 8 vCPUs, with up to 19.2TB (10x1.92TB) available on the largest VM sizes.

* The [Lsv3-series](lsv3-series) runs on the third Generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor in a [hyper-threaded configuration](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html). This new processor features an all-core turbo clock speed of 3.5 GHz with [IntelÂ® Turbo Boost Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [IntelÂ® Advanced-Vector Extensions 512 (IntelÂ® AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html) and [IntelÂ® Deep Learning Boost](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai/deep-learning-boost.html).
* The [Lasv3-series](lasv3-series) runs on the AMD 3rd Generation EPYCâ¢ 7763v processor. This series runs in a multi-threaded configuration with up to 256 MB L3 cache, which can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of 3.5 GHz.
* The [Lsv2-series](lsv2-series) runs on the [AMD EPYCâ¢ 7551 processor](https://www.amd.com/en/products/epyc-7000-series) with an all-core boost of 2.55 GHz and a max boost of 3.0 GHz.
