## In this article

VM Applications are a resource type in Azure Compute Gallery (formerly known as Shared Image Gallery) that simplifies management, sharing and global distribution of applications for your virtual machines.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

This article assumes you already have an Azure Compute Gallery. If you don't already have a gallery, create one first. To learn more, see [Create a gallery for storing and sharing resources](create-gallery)..

You should have uploaded your application to a container in an [Azure storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create). Your application can be stored in a block or page blob. If you choose to use a page blob, you need to byte align the files before you upload them. Here's a sample that will byte align your file:

```
$inputFile = <the file you want to pad>

$fileInfo = Get-Item -Path $inputFile

$remainder = $fileInfo.Length % 512

if ($remainder -ne 0){

    $difference = 512 - $remainder

    $bytesToPad = [System.Byte[]]::CreateInstance([System.Byte], $difference)

    Add-Content -Path $inputFile -Value $bytesToPad -Encoding Byte
    }

```

You need to make sure the files are publicly available, or you'll need the SAS URI for the files in your storage account. You can use [Storage Explorer](../vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-blobs) to quickly create a SAS URI if you don't already have one.

If you're using PowerShell, you need to be using version 3.11.0 of the Az.Storage module.

To learn more about the installation mechanism, see the [command interpreter.](vm-applications#command-interpreter)

## Create the VM application

Choose an option below for creating your VM application definition and version:

* [Portal](#tabpanel_1_portal)
* [CLI](#tabpanel_1_cli)
* [PowerShell](#tabpanel_1_powershell)
* [REST](#tabpanel_1_rest2)

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), then search for and select **Azure Compute Gallery**.
2. Select the gallery you want to use from the list.
3. On the page for your gallery, select **Add** from the top of the page and then select **VM application definition** from the drop-down. The **Create a VM application definition** page will open.
4. In the **Basics** tab, enter a name for your application and choose whether the application is for VMs running Linux or Windows.
5. Select the **Publishing options** tab if you want to specify any of the following optional settings for your VM application definition:
	* A description of the VM application definition.
	* End of life date
	* Link to a Eula
	* URI of a privacy statement
	* URI for release notes
6. When you're done, select **Review + create**.
7. When validation completes, select **Create** to have the definition deployed.
8. Once the deployment is complete, select **Go to resource**.
9. On the page for the application, select **Create a VM application version**. The **Create a VM Application Version** page will open.
10. Enter a version number like 1.0.0.
11. Select the region where you've uploaded your application package.
12. Under **Source application package**, select **Browse**. Select the storage account, then the container where your package is located. Select the package from the list and then click **Select** when you're done. Alternatively, you can paste the SAS URI in this field if preferred.
13. Type in the **Install script**. You can also provide the **Uninstall script** and **Update script**. See the [Overview](vm-applications#command-interpreter) for information on how to create the scripts.
14. If you have a default configuration file uploaded to a storage account, you can select it in **Default configuration**.
15. Select **Exclude from latest** if you don't want this version to appear as the latest version when you create a VM.
16. For **End of life date**, choose a date in the future to track when this version should be retired. It isn't deleted or removed automatically, it's only for your own tracking.
17. To replicate this version to other regions, select the **Replication** tab and add more regions and make changes to the number of replicas per region. The original region where your version was created must be in the list and can't be removed.
18. When you're done making changes, select **Review + create** at the bottom of the page.
19. When validation shows as passed, select **Create** to deploy your VM application version.

Now you can create a VM and deploy the VM application to it using the portal. Just create the VM as usual, and under the **Advanced** tab, choose **Select a VM application to install**.

![Screenshot of the Advanced tab where you can choose to install a VM application.](media/vmapps/advanced-tab.png)

Select the VM application from the list, and then select **Save** at the bottom of the page.

![Screenshot showing selecting a VM application to install on the VM.](media/vmapps/select-app.png)

If you've more than one VM application to install, you can set the install order for each VM application back on the **Advanced tab**.

You can also deploy the VM application to currently running VMs. Select the **Extensions + applications** option under **Settings** in the left menu when viewing the VM details in the portal.

Choose **VM applications** and then select **Add application** to add your VM application.

![Screenshot showing selecting a VM application to install on a currently running VM.](media/vmapps/select-extension-app.png)

Select the VM application from the list, and then select **Save** at the bottom of the page.

![Screenshot showing selecting a VM application to install on the VM.](media/vmapps/select-app.png)

To show the VM application status, go to the Extensions + applications tab/settings and check the status of the VMAppExtension:

VM applications require [Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) version 2.30.0 or later.

Create the VM application definition using [az sig gallery-application create](/en-us/cli/azure/sig/gallery-application#az_sig_gallery_application_create). In this example we're creating a VM application definition named *myApp* for Linux-based VMs.

```
az sig gallery-application create \
    --application-name myApp \
    --gallery-name myGallery \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --os-type Linux \
    --location "East US"

```

Create a VM application version using [az sig gallery-application version create](/en-us/cli/azure/sig/gallery-application/version#az-sig-gallery-application-version-create). Allowed characters for version are numbers and periods. Numbers must be within the range of a 32-bit integer. Format: *MajorVersion*.*MinorVersion*.*Patch*.

Replace the values of the parameters with your own.

```
az sig gallery-application version create \
   --version-name 1.0.0 \
   --application-name myApp \
   --gallery-name myGallery \
   --location "East US" \
   --resource-group myResourceGroup \
   --package-file-link "https://<storage account name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container name>/<filename>" \
   --install-command "mv myApp .\myApp\myApp" \
   --remove-command "rm .\myApp\myApp" \
   --update-command  "mv myApp .\myApp\myApp" \
   --default-configuration-file-link "https://<storage account name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container name>/<filename>"\

```

Set a VM application to an existing VM using [az vm application set](/en-us/cli/azure/vm/application#az-vm-application-set) and replace the values of the parameters with your own.

```
az vm application set \
	--resource-group myResourceGroup \
	--name myVM \
  --app-version-ids /subscriptions/{subID}/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/myGallery/applications/myApp/versions/1.0.0 \
  --treat-deployment-as-failure true

```

For setting multiple applications on a VM:

```
az vm application set \
	--resource-group myResourceGroup \
	--name myVM \
	--app-version-ids /subscriptions/{subId}/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/myGallery/applications/myApp/versions/1.0.0 /subscriptions/{subId}/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/myGallery/applications/myApp2/versions/1.0.1 \
	--treat-deployment-as-failure true true

```

To add an application to a VMSS, use [az vmss application set](/en-us/cli/azure/vmss/application#az-vmss-application-set):

```
az vmss application set -g myResourceGroup -n myVmss --app-version-ids /subscriptions/{subId}/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/myGallery/applications/myApp/versions/1.0.0
--treat-deployment-as-failure true

```

To add multiple applications to a VMSS:

```
az vmss application set -g myResourceGroup -n myVmss --app-version-ids /subscriptions/{subId}/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/myGallery/applications/myApp/versions/1.0.0 /subscriptions/{subId}/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/myGallery/applications/myApp2/versions/1.0.0
--treat-deployment-as-failure true

```

To verify application VM deployment status, use [az vm get-instance-view](/en-us/cli/azure/vm/#az-vm-get-instance-view):

```
az vm get-instance-view -g myResourceGroup -n myVM --query "instanceView.extensions[?name == 'VMAppExtension']"

```

To verify application VMSS deployment status, use [az vmss get-instance-view](/en-us/cli/azure/vmss/#az-vmss-get-instance-view):

```
az vmss get-instance-view --ids (az vmss list-instances -g myResourceGroup -n myVmss --query "[*].id" -o tsv) --query "[*].extensions[?name == 'VMAppExtension']"

```

Note

The above VMSS deployment status command does not list the instance ID with the result. To show the instance ID with the status of the extension in each instance, some additional scripting is required. Refer to the below VMSS CLI example that contains PowerShell syntax:

```
$ids = az vmss list-instances -g myResourceGroup -n myVMss --query "[*].{id: id, instanceId: instanceId}" | ConvertFrom-Json
$ids | Foreach-Object {
    $iid = $_.instanceId
    Write-Output "instanceId: $iid" 
    az vmss get-instance-view --ids $_.id --query "extensions[?name == 'VMAppExtension']" 
}

```

Create the VM application definition using `New-AzGalleryApplication`. In this example, we're creating a Linux app named *myApp* in the *myGallery* Azure Compute Gallery, in the *myGallery* resource group and I've given a short description of the VM application for my own use. Replace the values as needed.

```
$galleryName = "myGallery"
$rgName = "myResourceGroup"
$applicationName = "myApp"
New-AzGalleryApplication `
  -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
  -GalleryName $galleryName `
  -Location "East US" `
  -Name $applicationName `
  -SupportedOSType Linux `
  -Description "Backend Linux application for finance."

```

Create a version of your application using `New-AzGalleryApplicationVersion`. Allowed characters for version are numbers and periods. Numbers must be within the range of a 32-bit integer. Format: *MajorVersion*.*MinorVersion*.*Patch*.

In this example, we're creating version number *1.0.0*. Replace the values of the variables as needed.

```
$galleryName = "myGallery"
$rgName = "myResourceGroup"
$applicationName = "myApp"
$version = "1.0.0"
New-AzGalleryApplicationVersion `
   -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
   -GalleryName $galleryName `
   -GalleryApplicationName $applicationName `
   -Name $version `
   -PackageFileLink "https://<storage account name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container name>/<filename>" `
   -DefaultConfigFileLink "https://<storage account name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container name>/<filename>" `
   -Location "East US" `
   -Install "mv myApp .\myApp\myApp" `
   -Remove "rm .\myApp\myApp" `

```

To add the application to an existing VM, get the application version and use that to get the VM application version ID. Use the ID to add the application to the VM configuration.

```
$galleryName = "myGallery"
$rgName = "myResourceGroup"
$applicationName = "myApp"
$version = "1.0.0"
$vmName = "myVM"
$vm = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgname -Name $vmName
$appversion = Get-AzGalleryApplicationVersion `
   -GalleryApplicationName $applicationName `
   -GalleryName $galleryName `
   -Name $version `
   -ResourceGroupName $rgName
$packageid = $appversion.Id
$app = New-AzVmGalleryApplication -PackageReferenceId $packageid
Add-AzVmGalleryApplication -VM $vm -GalleryApplication $app -TreatFailureAsDeploymentFailure true
Update-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -VM $vm

```

To add the application to a VMSS:

```
$vmss = Get-AzVmss -ResourceGroupName $rgname -Name $vmssName
$appversion = Get-AzGalleryApplicationVersion `
   -GalleryApplicationName $applicationName `
   -GalleryName $galleryName `
   -Name $version `
   -ResourceGroupName $rgName
$packageid = $appversion.Id
$app = New-AzVmssGalleryApplication -PackageReferenceId $packageid
Add-AzVmssGalleryApplication -VirtualMachineScaleSetVM $vmss.VirtualMachineProfile -GalleryApplication $app
Update-AzVMss -ResourceGroupName $rgName -VirtualMachineScaleSet $vmss -VMScaleSetName $vmssName

```

Verify the application succeeded:

```
$rgName = "myResourceGroup"
$vmName = "myVM"
$result = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -VMName $vmName -Status
$result.Extensions | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "VMAppExtension"} | ConvertTo-Json

```

To verify for VMSS:

```
$rgName = "myResourceGroup"
$vmssName = "myVMss"
$result = Get-AzVmssVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -VMScaleSetName $vmssName -InstanceView
$resultSummary  = New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList
$result | ForEach-Object {
    $res = @{ instanceId = $_.InstanceId; vmappStatus = $_.InstanceView.Extensions | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "VMAppExtension"}}
    $resultSummary.Add($res) | Out-Null
}
$resultSummary | convertto-json -depth 5

```

Create the application definition.

| configurationReference | Optional. The full url of a storage blob containing the configuration for this deployment. This will override any value provided for defaultConfiguration earlier. | Valid storage blob reference |
| treatFailureAsDeploymentFailure | Optional. Provisioning status for VM App. When set to false, provisioning status will always show 'succeeded' regardless of app deployment failure. | True or False |

The order field may be used to specify dependencies between applications. The rules for order are the following:

| Case | Install Meaning | Failure Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No order specified | Unordered applications are installed after ordered applications. There's no guarantee of installation order amongst the unordered applications. | Installation failures of other applications, be it ordered or unordered doesnât affect the installation of unordered applications. |
| Duplicate order values | Application will be installed in any order compared to other applications with the same order. All applications of the same order will be installed after those with lower orders and before those with higher orders. | If a previous application with a lower order failed to install, no applications with this order will install. If any application with this order fails to install, no applications with a higher order will install. |
| Increasing orders | Application will be installed after those with lower orders and before those with higher orders. | If a previous application with a lower order failed to install, this application won't install. If this application fails to install, no application with a higher order will install. |

The response will include the full VM model. The following are the
relevant parts.

```
{
  "name": "{vm name}",
  "id": "{vm id}",
  "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines",
  "location": "{vm location}",
  "properties": {
    "applicationProfile": {
      "galleryApplications": ""
    },
    "provisioningState": "Updating"
  },
  "resources": [
    {
      "name": "VMAppExtension",
      "id": "{extension id}",
      "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions",
      "location": "centraluseuap",
      "properties": "@{autoUpgradeMinorVersion=True; forceUpdateTag=7c4223fc-f4ea-4179-ada8-c8a85a1399f5; provisioningState=Creating; publisher=Microsoft.CPlat.Core; type=VMApplicationManagerLinux; typeHandlerVersion=1.0; settings=}"
    }
  ]
}

```

If the VM applications haven't yet been installed on the VM, the value will be empty.

To get the result of VM instance view:

```
GET
/subscriptions/\<**subscriptionId**\>/resourceGroups/\<**resourceGroupName**\>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/\<**VMName**\>/instanceView?api-version=2019-03-01

```

The result will look like this:

```
{
    ...
    "extensions"  [
    ...
        {
            "name":  "VMAppExtension",
            "type":  "Microsoft.CPlat.Core.VMApplicationManagerLinux",
            "typeHandlerVersion":  "1.0.9",
            "statuses":  [
                            {
                                "code":  "ProvisioningState/succeeded",
                                "level":  "Info",
                                "displayStatus":  "Provisioning succeeded",
                                "message":  "Enable succeeded: {\n \"CurrentState\": [\n  {\n   \"applicationName\": \"doNothingLinux\",\n   \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n   \"result\": \"Install SUCCESS\"\n  },\n  {
        \n   \"applicationName\": \"badapplinux\",\n   \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n   \"result\": \"Install FAILED Error executing command \u0027exit 1\u0027: command terminated with exit status=1\"\n  }\n ],\n \"ActionsPerformed\": []\n}
        "
                            }
                        ]
        }
    ...
    ]
}

```

The VM App status is in the status message of the result of the VMApp extension in the instance view.

To get the status for a VMSS Application:

```
GET
/subscriptions/\<**subscriptionId**\>/resourceGroups/\<**resourceGroupName**\>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/ virtualMachineScaleSets/\<**VMSSName**\>/virtualMachines/<**instanceId**>/instanceView?api-version=2019-03-01

```

The output will be similar to the VM example earlier.
