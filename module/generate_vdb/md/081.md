Dv2 and Dsv2-series, a follow-on to the original D-series, features a more powerful CPU. DSv2-series sizes run on the 3rd Generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake), the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake), the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® 8171M 2.1 GHz (Skylake), the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® E5-2673 v4 2.3 GHz (Broadwell), or the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® E5-2673 v3 2.4 GHz (Haswell) processors. The Dv2-series has the same memory and disk configurations as the D-series.

1 The maximum disk throughput (IOPS or MBps) possible with a DSv2 series VM may be limited by the number, size and striping of the attached disk(s). For details, see [Designing for high performance](premium-storage-performance).
2 Instance is isolated to the Intel Haswell based hardware and dedicated to a single customer.  

## Size table definitions

* Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
* Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
* Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **ReadOnly** or **ReadWrite**. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **None**.
* To learn how to get the best storage performance for your VMs, see [Virtual machine and disk performance](disks-performance).
* **Expected network bandwidth** is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, see [Virtual machine network bandwidth](../virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput).

Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, see [Optimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines](../virtual-network/virtual-network-optimize-network-bandwidth). To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, see [Bandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP)](../virtual-network/virtual-network-bandwidth-testing).
