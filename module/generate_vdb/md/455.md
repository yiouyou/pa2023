This article explains how to either upload a VHD from your local machine to an Azure managed disk or copy a managed disk to another region, using AzCopy. This process, direct upload, enables you to upload a VHD up to 32 TiB in size directly into a managed disk. Currently, direct upload is supported for standard HDD, standard SSD, and premium SSD managed disks. It isn't supported for ultra disks, yet.

If you're providing a backup solution for IaaS VMs in Azure, you should use direct upload to restore customer backups to managed disks. When uploading a VHD from a source external to Azure, speeds depend on your local bandwidth. When uploading or copying from an Azure VM, your bandwidth would be the same as standard HDDs.

## Secure uploads with Azure AD

If you're using [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](../../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) to control resource access, you can now use it to restrict uploading of Azure managed disks. This feature is available as a GA offering in all regions. When a user attempts to upload a disk, Azure validates the identity of the requesting user in Azure AD, and confirms that user has the required permissions. At a higher level, a system administrator could set a policy at the Azure account or subscription level, to ensure that an Azure AD identity has the necessary permissions for uploading before allowing a disk or a disk snapshot to be uploaded. If you have any questions on securing uploads with Azure AD, reach out to this email: azuredisks@microsoft .com

### Prerequisites

* [Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

### Restrictions

* VHDs can't be uploaded to empty snapshots.
* Azure Backup doesn't currently support disks secured with Azure AD.

### Assign RBAC role

To access managed disks secured with Azure AD, the requesting user must have either the [Data Operator for Managed Disks](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#data-operator-for-managed-disks) role, or a [custom role](../../role-based-access-control/custom-roles-powershell) with the following permissions:

* **Microsoft.Compute/disks/download/action**
* **Microsoft.Compute/disks/upload/action**
* **Microsoft.Compute/snapshots/download/action**
* **Microsoft.Compute/snapshots/upload/action**

For detailed steps on assigning a role, see [Assign Azure roles using Azure CLI](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-cli). To create or update a custom role, see [Create or update Azure custom roles using Azure CLI](../../role-based-access-control/custom-roles-cli).

## Get started

If you'd prefer to upload disks through a GUI, you can do so using Azure Storage Explorer. For details refer to: [Use Azure Storage Explorer to manage Azure managed disks](../disks-use-storage-explorer-managed-disks)

### Prerequisites

* Download the latest [version of AzCopy v10](../../storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10#download-and-install-azcopy).
* [Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
* If you intend to upload a VHD from on-premises: A fixed size VHD that [has been prepared for Azure](../windows/prepare-for-upload-vhd-image), stored locally.
* Or, a managed disk in Azure, if you intend to perform a copy action.

To upload your VHD to Azure, you'll need to create an empty managed disk that is configured for this upload process. Before you create one, there's some additional information you should know about these disks.

This kind of managed disk has two unique states:

* ReadToUpload, which means the disk is ready to receive an upload but, no [secure access signature](../../storage/common/storage-sas-overview) (SAS) has been generated.
* ActiveUpload, which means that the disk is ready to receive an upload and the SAS has been generated.

Note

While in either of these states, the managed disk will be billed at [standard HDD pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/), regardless of the actual type of disk. For example, a P10 will be billed as an S10. This will be true until `revoke-access` is called on the managed disk, which is required in order to attach the disk to a VM.

## Create an empty managed disk

Before you can create an empty standard HDD for uploading, you'll need the file size of the VHD you want to upload, in bytes. To get that, you can use either `wc -c <yourFileName>.vhd` or `ls -al <yourFileName>.vhd`. This value is used when specifying the **--upload-size-bytes** parameter.

Create an empty standard HDD for uploading by specifying both the **-âfor-upload** parameter and the **--upload-size-bytes** parameter in a [disk create](/en-us/cli/azure/disk#az-disk-create) cmdlet:

Replace `<yourdiskname>`, `<yourresourcegroupname>`, `<yourregion>` with values of your choosing. The `--upload-size-bytes` parameter contains an example value of `34359738880`, replace it with a value appropriate for you.

Tip

If you're creating an OS disk, add `--hyper-v-generation <yourGeneration>` to `az disk create`.

If you're using Azure AD to secure disk uploads, add `-dataAccessAuthmode 'AzureActiveDirectory'`.

```
az disk create -n <yourdiskname> -g <yourresourcegroupname> -l <yourregion> --os-type Linux --for-upload --upload-size-bytes 34359738880 --sku standard_lrs

```

If you would like to upload either a premium SSD or a standard SSD, replace **standard\_lrs** with either **premium\_LRS** or **standardssd\_lrs**. Ultra disks are not supported for now.

### (Optional) Grant access to the disk

If you're using Azure AD to secure uploads, you'll need to [assign RBAC permissions](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-cli) to grant access to the disk and generate a writeable SAS.

```
az role assignment create --assignee "{assignee}" \
--role "{Data Operator for Managed Disks}" \
--scope "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/{providerName}/{resourceType}/{resourceSubType}/{diskName}"

```

### Generate writeable SAS

Now that you've created an empty managed disk that is configured for the upload process, you can upload a VHD to it. To upload a VHD to the disk, you'll need a writeable SAS, so that you can reference it as the destination for your upload.

To generate a writable SAS of your empty managed disk, replace `<yourdiskname>`and `<yourresourcegroupname>`, then use the following command:

```
az disk grant-access -n <yourdiskname> -g <yourresourcegroupname> --access-level Write --duration-in-seconds 86400

```

Sample returned value:

```
{
  "accessSas": "https://md-impexp-t0rdsfgsdfg4.blob.core.windows.net/w2c3mj0ksfgl/abcd?sv=2017-04-17&sr=b&si=600a9281-d39e-4cc3-91d2-923c4a696537&sig=xXaT6mFgf139ycT87CADyFxb%2BnPXBElYirYRlbnJZbs%3D"
}

```

## Upload a VHD

Now that you have a SAS for your empty managed disk, you can use it to set your managed disk as the destination for your upload command.

Use AzCopy v10 to upload your local VHD file to a managed disk by specifying the SAS URI you generated.

This upload has the same throughput as the equivalent [standard HDD](../disks-types#standard-hdds). For example, if you have a size that equates to S4, you will have a throughput of up to 60 MiB/s. But, if you have a size that equates to S70, you will have a throughput of up to 500 MiB/s.

```
AzCopy.exe copy "c:\somewhere\mydisk.vhd"â¯"sas-URI" --blob-type PageBlob

```

After the upload is complete, and you no longer need to write any more data to the disk, revoke the SAS. Revoking the SAS will change the state of the managed disk and allow you to attach the disk to a VM.

Replace `<yourdiskname>`and `<yourresourcegroupname>`, then use the following command to make the disk usable:

```
az disk revoke-access -n <yourdiskname> -g <yourresourcegroupname>

```

## Copy a managed disk

Direct upload also simplifies the process of copying a managed disk. You can either copy within the same region or cross-region (to another region).

The following script will do this for you, the process is similar to the steps described earlier, with some differences since you're working with an existing disk.

Important

You need to add an offset of 512 when you're providing the disk size in bytes of a managed disk from Azure. This is because Azure omits the footer when returning the disk size. The copy will fail if you don't do this. The following script already does this for you.

Replace the `<sourceResourceGroupHere>`, `<sourceDiskNameHere>`, `<targetDiskNameHere>`, `<targetResourceGroupHere>`, and `<yourTargetLocationHere>` (an example of a location value would be uswest2) with your values, then run the following script in order to copy a managed disk.

Tip

If you are creating an OS disk, add `--hyper-v-generation <yourGeneration>` to `az disk create`.

```
sourceDiskName=<sourceDiskNameHere>
sourceRG=<sourceResourceGroupHere>
targetDiskName=<targetDiskNameHere>
targetRG=<targetResourceGroupHere>
targetLocation=<yourTargetLocationHere>
#Expected value for OS is either "Windows" or "Linux"
targetOS=<yourOSTypeHere>

sourceDiskSizeBytes=$(az disk show -g $sourceRG -n $sourceDiskName --query '[diskSizeBytes]' -o tsv)

az disk create -g $targetRG -n $targetDiskName -l $targetLocation --os-type $targetOS --for-upload --upload-size-bytes $(($sourceDiskSizeBytes+512)) --sku standard_lrs

targetSASURI=$(az disk grant-access -n $targetDiskName -g $targetRG  --access-level Write --duration-in-seconds 86400 -o tsv)

sourceSASURI=$(az disk grant-access -n $sourceDiskName -g $sourceRG --duration-in-seconds 86400 --query [accessSas] -o tsv)

azcopy copy $sourceSASURI $targetSASURI --blob-type PageBlob

az disk revoke-access -n $sourceDiskName -g $sourceRG

az disk revoke-access -n $targetDiskName -g $targetRG

```

## Next steps

Now that you've successfully uploaded a VHD to a managed disk, you can attach the disk as a [data disk to an existing VM](add-disk) or [attach the disk to a VM as an OS disk](upload-vhd#create-the-vm), to create a new VM.

If you've additional questions, see the [uploading a managed disk](../faq-for-disks#uploading-to-a-managed-disk) section in the FAQ.
