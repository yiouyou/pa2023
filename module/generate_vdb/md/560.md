## In this article

The first step in understanding compliance in Azure is to identify the status of your resources.
This quickstart steps you through the process of creating a policy assignment to identify virtual
machines that aren't using managed disks.

At the end of this process, you'll successfully identify virtual machines that aren't using managed
disks. They're *non-compliant* with the policy assignment.

REST API is used to create and manage Azure resources. This guide uses REST API to create a policy
assignment and to identify non-compliant resources in your Azure environment.

## Prerequisites

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
account before you begin.
* If you haven't already, install [ARMClient](https://github.com/projectkudu/ARMClient). It's a tool
that sends HTTP requests to Azure Resource Manager-based REST APIs. You can also use the "Try It"
feature in REST documentation or tooling like PowerShell's
[Invoke-RestMethod](/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-restmethod) or
[Postman](https://www.postman.com).

## Azure Cloud Shell

Azure hosts Azure Cloud Shell, an interactive shell environment that you can use through your browser. You can use either Bash or PowerShell with Cloud Shell to work with Azure services. You can use the Cloud Shell preinstalled commands to run the code in this article, without having to install anything on your local environment.

To start Azure Cloud Shell:

| Option | Example/Link |
| --- | --- |
| Select **Try It** in the upper-right corner of a code or command block. Selecting **Try It** doesn't automatically copy the code or command to Cloud Shell. | Screenshot that shows an example of Try It for Azure Cloud Shell. |
| Go to <https://shell.azure.com>, or select the **Launch Cloud Shell** button to open Cloud Shell in your browser. | [Screenshot that shows how to launch Cloud Shell in a new window.](https://shell.azure.com) |
| Select the **Cloud Shell** button on the menu bar at the upper right in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). | Screenshot that shows the Cloud Shell button in the Azure portal |

To use Azure Cloud Shell:

1. Start Cloud Shell.
2. Select the **Copy** button on a code block (or command block) to copy the code or command.
3. Paste the code or command into the Cloud Shell session by selecting **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**V** on Windows and Linux, or by selecting **Cmd**+**Shift**+**V** on macOS.
4. Select **Enter** to run the code or command.

## Create a policy assignment

In this quickstart, you create a policy assignment and assign the **Audit VMs that do not use
managed disks** (`06a78e20-9358-41c9-923c-fb736d382a4d`) definition. This policy definition
identifies resources that aren't compliant to the conditions set in the policy definition.

Run the following command to create a policy assignment:

* REST API URI

```
PUT https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/audit-vm-manageddisks?api-version=2021-09-01

```
* Request Body

```
{
  "properties": {
    "displayName": "Audit VMs without managed disks Assignment",
    "description": "Shows all virtual machines not using managed disks",
    "policyDefinitionId": "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/06a78e20-9358-41c9-923c-fb736d382a4d",
    "nonComplianceMessages": [
        {
            "message": "Virtual machines should use a managed disk"
        }
    ]
  }
}

```

The preceding endpoint and request body uses the following information:

REST API URI:

* **Scope** - A scope determines what resources or grouping of resources the policy assignment gets
enforced on. It could range from a management group to an individual resource. Be sure to replace
`{scope}` with one of the following patterns:
	+ Management group: `/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{managementGroup}`
	+ Subscription: `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}`
	+ Resource group: `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}`
	+ Resource: `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/{resourceProviderNamespace}/[{parentResourcePath}/]{resourceType}/{resourceName}`
* **Name** - The actual name of the assignment. For this example, *audit-vm-manageddisks* was used.

Request Body:

* **DisplayName** - Display name for the policy assignment. In this case, you're using *Audit VMs
without managed disks Assignment*.
* **Description** - A deeper explanation of what the policy does or why it's assigned to this scope.
* **policyDefinitionId** - The policy definition ID, based on which you're using to create the
assignment. In this case, it's the ID of policy definition *Audit VMs that do not use managed
disks*.
* **nonComplianceMessages** - Set the message seen when a resource is denied due to non-compliance
or evaluated to be non-compliant. For more information, see
[assignment non-compliance messages](concepts/assignment-structure#non-compliance-messages).

## Identify non-compliant resources

To view the resources that aren't compliant under this new assignment, run the following command to
get the resource IDs of the non-compliant resources that are output into a JSON file:

```
POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/06a78e20-9358-41c9-923c-fb736d382a4d/providers/Microsoft.PolicyInsights/policyStates/latest/queryResults?api-version=2019-10-01&$filter=IsCompliant eq false and PolicyAssignmentId eq 'audit-vm-manageddisks'&$apply=groupby((ResourceId))"

```

Your results resemble the following example:

```
{
    "@odata.context": "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/providers/Microsoft.PolicyInsights/policyStates/$metadata#latest",
    "@odata.count": 3,
    "value": [{
            "@odata.id": null,
            "@odata.context": "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/providers/Microsoft.PolicyInsights/policyStates/$metadata#latest/$entity",
            "ResourceId": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourcegroups/<rgname>/providers/microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/<virtualmachineId>"
        },
        {
            "@odata.id": null,
            "@odata.context": "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/providers/Microsoft.PolicyInsights/policyStates/$metadata#latest/$entity",
            "ResourceId": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourcegroups/<rgname>/providers/microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/<virtualmachine2Id>"
        },
        {
            "@odata.id": null,
            "@odata.context": "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/providers/Microsoft.PolicyInsights/policyStates/$metadata#latest/$entity",
            "ResourceId": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionName>/resourcegroups/<rgname>/providers/microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/<virtualmachine3Id>"
        }

    ]
}

```

The results are comparable to what you'd typically see listed under **Non-compliant resources** in
the Azure portal view.

## Clean up resources

To remove the assignment created, use the following command:

```
DELETE https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/audit-vm-manageddisks?api-version=2021-09-01

```

Replace `{scope}` with the scope you used when you first created the policy assignment.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you assigned a policy definition to identify non-compliant resources in your
Azure environment.
