## In this article

Azure Monitor Logs provides monitoring capabilities across cloud and on-premises assets. Microsoft publishes and supports the Log Analytics agent virtual machine (VM) extension for Windows. The extension installs the Log Analytics agent on Azure VMs, and enrolls VMs into an existing Log Analytics workspace. This article describes the supported platforms, configurations, and deployment options for the Log Analytics agent VM extension for Windows.

Important

The Log Analytics agent is on a **deprecation path** and won't be supported after **August 31, 2024**. If you use the Log Analytics agent to ingest data to Azure Monitor, [migrate to the new Azure Monitor agent](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-migration) prior to that date.

## Prerequisites

Review the following prerequisites for using the Log Analytics agent VM extension for Windows.

### Operating system

For details about the supported Windows operating systems, see the [Overview of Azure Monitor agents](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview#supported-operating-systems) article.

### Microsoft Defender for Cloud

Microsoft Defender for Cloud automatically provisions the Log Analytics agent and connects it with the default Log Analytics workspace of the Azure subscription.

Important

If you're using Microsoft Defender for Cloud, don't follow the extension deployment methods described in this article. These deployment processes overwrite the configured Log Analytics workspace and break the connection with Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

### Azure Arc

You can use Azure Arc-enabled servers to deploy, remove, and update the Log Analytics agent VM extension to non-Azure Windows and Linux machines. This approach simplifies the management of your hybrid machine through their lifecycle. For more information, see [VM extension management with Azure Arc-enabled servers](/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/manage-vm-extensions).

### Internet connectivity

The Log Analytics agent VM extension for Windows requires that the target VM is connected to the internet.

## Extension schema

The following JSON shows the schema for the Log Analytics agent VM extension for Windows. The extension requires the workspace ID and workspace key from the target Log Analytics workspace. These items can be found in the settings for the workspace in the Azure portal.

Because the workspace key should be treated as sensitive data, it should be stored in a protected setting configuration. Azure VM extension protected-setting data is encrypted, and it's only decrypted on the target VM.

Note

The values for `workspaceId` and `workspaceKey` are case-sensitive.

```
{
    "type": "extensions",
    "name": "OMSExtension",
    "apiVersion": "[variables('apiVersion')]",
    "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
    "dependsOn": [
        "[concat('Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/', variables('vmName'))]"
    ],
    "properties": {
        "publisher": "Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring",
        "type": "MicrosoftMonitoringAgent",
        "typeHandlerVersion": "1.0",
        "autoUpgradeMinorVersion": true,
        "settings": {
            "workspaceId": "myWorkSpaceId"
        },
        "protectedSettings": {
            "workspaceKey": "myWorkspaceKey"
        }
    }
}

```

### Property values

The JSON schema includes the following properties.

| Name | Value/Example |
| --- | --- |
| `apiVersion` | 2015-06-15 |
| `publisher` | Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring |
| `type` | MicrosoftMonitoringAgent |
| `typeHandlerVersion` | 1.0 |
| `workspaceId (e.g)`**\*** | 6f680a37-00c6-41c7-a93f-1437e3462574 |
| `workspaceKey (e.g)` | z4bU3p1/GrnWpQkky4gdabWXAhbWSTz70hm4m2Xt92XI+rSRgE8qVvRhsGo9TXffbrTahyrwv35W0pOqQAU7uQ== |

**\*** The `workspaceId` schema property is specified as the `consumerId` property in the Log Analytics API.

## Template deployment

Azure VM extensions can be deployed with Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates. The JSON schema detailed in the previous section can be used in an ARM template to run the Log Analytics agent VM extension during an ARM template deployment. A sample template that includes the Log Analytics agent VM extension can be found on the [Azure Quickstart Gallery](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/demos/oms-extension-windows-vm).

Note

The ARM template doesn't support specifying more than one workspace ID and workspace key when you want to configure the Log Analytics agent to report to multiple workspaces. To configure the Log Analytics agent VM extension to report to multiple workspaces, see [Add or remove a workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agent-manage?tabs=PowerShellLinux#add-or-remove-a-workspace).

The JSON for a VM extension can be nested inside the VM resource, or placed at the root or top level of a JSON ARM template. The placement of the JSON affects the value of the resource name and type. For more information, see [Set name and type for child resources](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/child-resource-name-type).

The following example assumes the Log Analytics agent VM extension is nested inside the VM resource. When you nest the extension resource, the JSON is placed in the `"resources": []` object of the VM.

```
{
    "type": "extensions",
    "name": "OMSExtension",
    "apiVersion": "[variables('apiVersion')]",
    "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
    "dependsOn": [
        "[concat('Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/', variables('vmName'))]"
    ],
    "properties": {
        "publisher": "Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring",
        "type": "MicrosoftMonitoringAgent",
        "typeHandlerVersion": "1.0",
        "autoUpgradeMinorVersion": true,
        "settings": {
            "workspaceId": "myWorkSpaceId"
        },
        "protectedSettings": {
            "workspaceKey": "myWorkspaceKey"
        }
    }
}

```

When you place the extension JSON at the root of the ARM template, the resource `name` includes a reference to the parent VM, and the `type` reflects the nested configuration.

```
{
    "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions",
    "name": "<parentVmResource>/OMSExtension",
    "apiVersion": "[variables('apiVersion')]",
    "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
    "dependsOn": [
        "[concat('Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/', variables('vmName'))]"
    ],
    "properties": {
        "publisher": "Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring",
        "type": "MicrosoftMonitoringAgent",
        "typeHandlerVersion": "1.0",
        "autoUpgradeMinorVersion": true,
        "settings": {
            "workspaceId": "myWorkSpaceId"
        },
        "protectedSettings": {
            "workspaceKey": "myWorkspaceKey"
        }
    }
}

```

## PowerShell deployment

The `Set-AzVMExtension` command can be used to deploy the Log Analytics agent VM extension to an existing VM. Before you run the command, store the public and private configurations in a [PowerShell hashtable](/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/deep-dives/everything-about-hashtable).

```
$PublicSettings = @{"workspaceId" = "myWorkspaceId"}
$ProtectedSettings = @{"workspaceKey" = "myWorkspaceKey"}

Set-AzVMExtension -ExtensionName "MicrosoftMonitoringAgent" `
    -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
    -VMName "myVM" `
    -Publisher "Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring" `
    -ExtensionType "MicrosoftMonitoringAgent" `
    -TypeHandlerVersion 1.0 `
    -Settings $PublicSettings `
    -ProtectedSettings $ProtectedSettings `
    -Location WestUS 

```

##  Troubleshoot issues

Here are some suggestions for how to troubleshoot deployment issues.

### View extension status

Check the status of your extension deployment in the Azure portal, or by using PowerShell or the Azure CLI.

To see the deployment state of extensions for a given VM, run the following commands.

* Azure PowerShell:

```
Get-AzVMExtension -ResourceGroupName <myResourceGroup> -VMName <myVM> -Name <myExtensionName>

```
* The Azure CLI:

```
az vm get-instance-view --resource-group <myResourceGroup> --name <myVM> --query "instanceView.extensions"

```

### Review output logs

View output logs for the Log Analytics agent VM extension for Windows under
`C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\Plugins\Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring.MicrosoftMonitoringAgent\`.
