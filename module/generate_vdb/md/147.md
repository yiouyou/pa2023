Maximizing HPC application performance on Intel Xeon Scalable Processors requires a thoughtful approach to process placement on this new architecture. Here, we outline our implementation of it on Azure HC-series VMs for HPC applications. We will use the term âpNUMAâ to refer to a physical NUMA domain, and âvNUMAâ to refer to a virtualized NUMA domain. Similarly, we will use the term âpCoreâ to refer to physical CPU cores, and âvCoreâ to refer to virtualized CPU cores.

Physically, an [HC-series](hc-series) server is 2 \* 24-core Intel Xeon Platinum 8168 CPUs for a total of 48 physical cores. Each CPU is a single pNUMA domain, and has unified access to six channels of DRAM. Intel Xeon Platinum CPUs feature a 4x larger L2 cache than in prior generations (256 KB/core -> 1 MB/core), while also reducing the L3 cache compared to prior Intel CPUs (2.5 MB/core -> 1.375 MB/core).

The above topology carries over to the HC-series hypervisor configuration as well. To provide room for the Azure hypervisor to operate without interfering with the VM, we reserve pCores 0-1 and 24-25 (that is, the first 2 pCores on each socket). We then assign pNUMA domains all remaining cores to the VM. Thus, the VM will see:

`(2 vNUMA domains) * (22 cores/vNUMA) = 44` cores per VM

The VM has no knowledge that pCores 0-1 and 24-25 weren't given to it. Thus, it exposes each vNUMA as if it natively had 22 cores.

Intel Xeon Platinum, Gold, and Silver CPUs also introduce an on-die 2D mesh network for communication within and external to the CPU socket. We strongly recommend process pinning for optimal performance and consistency. Process pinning will work on HC-series VMs because the underlying silicon is exposed as-is to the guest VM.

The following diagram shows the segregation of cores reserved for Azure Hypervisor and the HC-series VM.
