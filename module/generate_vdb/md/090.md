The Edv5 and Edsv5-series Virtual Machines run on the 3rd Generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor in a [hyper threaded](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html) configuration, providing a better value proposition for most general-purpose workloads. This new processor features an all core turbo clock speed of 3.5 GHz with [IntelÂ® Turbo Boost Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [IntelÂ® Advanced-Vector Extensions 512 (IntelÂ® AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html) and [IntelÂ® Deep Learning Boost](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai/deep-learning-boost.html). The Edv5 and Edsv5-series feature up to 672 GiB of RAM. These virtual machines are ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications, relational database servers, and in-memory analytics workloads. These VMs also feature fast and large local SSD storage (up to 3,900 GiB).

## Edv5-series

Edv5-series virtual machines run on the 3rd Generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor reaching an all core turbo clock speed of up to 3.5 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 104 vCPU and 672 GiB of RAM and fast, local SSD storage up to 3800 GiB. Edv5-series virtual machines are ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications and applications that benefit from low latency, high-speed local storage.

Edv5-series virtual machines support Standard SSD and Standard HDD disk types. To use Premium SSD or Ultra Disk storage, select Edsv5-series virtual machines. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. [See pricing for disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/).

## Edsv5-series

Edsv5-series virtual machines run on the 3rd Generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor reaching an all core turbo clock speed of up to 3.5 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 104 vCPU and 672 GiB of RAM and fast, local SSD storage up to 3800 GiB. Edsv5-series virtual machines are ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications and applications that benefit from low latency, high-speed local storage.

Edsv5-series virtual machines support Standard SSD and Standard HDD disk types. You can attach Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk storage to these VMs. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. [See pricing for disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/). The Edsv5-series virtual machines can [burst](disk-bursting) their disk performance and get up to their bursting max for up to 30 minutes at a time.

\* These IOPs values can be guaranteed by using [Gen2 VMs](generation-2)

1 Accelerated networking is required and turned on by default on all Edsv5 virtual machines.

2 [Constrained Core](constrained-vcpu) sizes available.

3 Instance is [isolated](../security/fundamentals/isolation-choices#compute-isolation) to hardware dedicated to a single customer.

4 Attaching Ultra Disk or Premium v2 SSD to **Standard\_E104ids\_v5** results in higher IOPs and MBps than standard premium disks:

* Max uncached Ultra Disk and Premium v2 SSD throughput (IOPS/ MBps): 120000/4000
* Max burst uncached Ultra Disk and Premium v2 SSD disk throughput (IOPS/ MBps): 120000/4000

## Size table definitions

* Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
* Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
* Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **ReadOnly** or **ReadWrite**. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **None**.
* To learn how to get the best storage performance for your VMs, see [Virtual machine and disk performance](disks-performance).
* **Expected network bandwidth** is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, see [Virtual machine network bandwidth](../virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput).

Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, see [Optimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines](../virtual-network/virtual-network-optimize-network-bandwidth). To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, see [Bandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP)](../virtual-network/virtual-network-bandwidth-testing).
