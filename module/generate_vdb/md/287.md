## In this article

When hosting a Linux virtual machine on Azure, the most common method for accessing that VM is through the Secure Shell Protocol (SSH). Any standard SSH client commonly found in Linux and Windows allows you to connect. You can also use [Azure Cloud Shell](../cloud-shell/overview) from any browser.

This document describes how to connect, via SSH, to a VM that has a public IP. If you need to connect to a VM without a public IP, see [Azure Bastion Service](../bastion/bastion-overview).

## Prerequisites

* You need an SSH key pair. If you don't already have one, Azure creates a key pair during the deployment process. If you need help with creating one manually, see [Create and use an SSH public-private key pair for Linux VMs in Azure](linux/mac-create-ssh-keys).
* You need an existing Network Security Group (NSG). Most VMs have an NSG by default, but if you don't already have one you can create one and attach it manually. For more information, see [Create, change, or delete a network security group](../virtual-network/manage-network-security-group).
* To connect to a Linux VM, you need the appropriate port open. Typically SSH uses port 22. The following instructions assume port 22 but the process is the same for other port numbers. You can validate an appropriate port is open for SSH using the troubleshooter or by checking manually in your VM settings. To check if port 22 is open:

	1. On the page for the VM, select **Networking** from the left menu.
	2. On the **Networking** page, check to see if there's a rule that allows TCP on port 22 from the IP address of the computer you're using to connect to the VM. If the rule exists, you can move to the next section.

	![Screenshot showing how to check to see if there's already a rule allowing S S H connections.](media/linux-vm-connect/check-rule.png)
	3. If there isn't a rule, add one by selecting **Add inbound port rule**.
	4. For **Service**, select **SSH** from the dropdown.

	5. Edit **Priority** and **Source** if necessary
	6. For **Name**, type *SSH*.
	7. When you're done, select **Add**.
	8. You should now have an SSH rule in the table of inbound port rules.
* Your VM must have a public IP address. To check if your VM has a public IP address, select **Overview** from the left menu and look at the **Networking** section. If you see an IP address next to **Public IP address**, then your VM has a public IP

If your VM doesn't have a public IP Address, it looks like this:

To learn more about adding a public IP address to an existing VM, see [Associate a public IP address to a virtual machine](../virtual-network/ip-services/associate-public-ip-address-vm)
* Verify your VM is running. On the Overview tab, in the **Essentials** section, verify the status of the VM is **Running**. To start the VM, select **Start** at the top of the page.

If you're having trouble connecting, you can also use portal:

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) to connect to a VM. Search for and select **Virtual machines**.
2. Select the virtual machine from the list.
3. Select **Connect** from the left menu.
4. Select the option that fits with your preferred way of connecting. The portal helps walk you through the prerequisites for connecting.

## Connect to the VM

Once the above prerequisites are met, you're ready to connect to your VM. Open your SSH client of choice. The SSH client command is typically included in Linux, macOS, and Windows. If you're using Windows 7 or older, where Win32 OpenSSH isn't included by default, consider installing [WSL](/en-us/windows/wsl/about) or using [Azure Cloud Shell](../cloud-shell/overview) from the browser.

Note

The following examples assume the SSH key is in the key.pem format. If you used CLI or Azure PowerShell to download your keys, they may be in the id\_rsa format.

* [WSL, macOS, or native Linux client](#tabpanel_1_Linux)
* [Windows command line (cmd.exe, PowerShell etc.)](#tabpanel_1_Windows)

### SSH with a new key pair

1. Ensure your public and private keys are in the correct directory. The directory is usually `~/.ssh`.

If you generated keys manually or generated them with the CLI, then the keys are probably already there. However, if you downloaded them in pem format from the Azure portal, you may need to move them to the right location. Moving the keys is done with the following syntax: `mv PRIVATE_KEY_SOURCE PRIVATE_KEY_DESTINATION`

For example, if the key is in the `Downloads` folder, and `myKey.pem` is the name of your SSH key, type:

```
mv /Downloads/myKey.pem ~/.ssh

```

Note

If you're using WSL, local files are found in the `mnt/c/` directory. Accordingly, the path to the downloads folder and SSH key would be `/mnt/c/Users/{USERNAME}/Downloads/myKey.pem`
2. Ensure you have read-only access to the private key by running

```
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/myKey.pem

```
3. Run the SSH command with the following syntax: `ssh -i PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY USERNAME@EXTERNAL_IP`

For example, if your `azureuser` is the username you created and `20.51.230.13` is the public IP address of your VM, type:

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/myKey.pem azureuser@20.51.230.13

```
4. Validate the returned fingerprint.

If you have never connected to this VM before, you're asked to verify the hosts fingerprint. It's tempting to accept the fingerprint presented, but that exposes you to a potential person in the middle attack. You should always validate the hosts fingerprint. You only need to do this the first time you connect from a client. To get the host fingerprint via the portal, use the Run Command feature to execute the command:

```
ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub | awk '{print $2}'

```
5. Success! You should now be connected to your VM. If you're unable to connect, see [Troubleshoot SSH connections](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshoot-ssh-connection).

### SSH With existing public key

1. Run the following command in your SSH client. In this example, *20.51.230.13* is the public IP Address of your VM and *azureuser* is the username you created when you created the VM.

```
ssh azureuser@20.51.230.13

```
2. Validate the returned fingerprint.

If you have never connected to the desired VM from your current SSH client before you're asked to verify the host's fingerprint. While the default option is to accept the fingerprint presented, you're exposed to a possible "person in the middle attack". You should always validate the host's fingerprint, which only needs to be done the first time your client connects. To obtain the host fingerprint via the portal, use the Run Command feature to execute the command:

```
ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub | awk '{print $2}'

```
3. Success! You should now be connected to your VM. If you're unable to connect, see our [troubleshooting guide](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshoot-ssh-connection).

### Password authentication

Warning

This type of authentication method is not as secure as an SSH key pair and is not recommended.

1. Run the following command in your SSH client. In this example, *20.51.230.13* is the public IP Address of your VM and *azureuser* is the username you created when you created the VM.

```
ssh azureuser@20.51.230.13

```

If you forgot your password or username see [Reset Access to an Azure VM](extensions/vmaccess)

### SSH with a new key pair

1. Locate your private SSH Key
2. Run the SSH command with the following syntax: `ssh -i PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY USERNAME@EXTERNAL_IP`

For example, if your `azureuser` is the username you created and `20.51.230.13` is the public IP address of your VM, type:

```
ssh -i  .\Downloads\myKey.pem azureuser@20.51.230.13 

```
3. Validate the returned fingerprint.

If you have never connected to the desired VM from your current SSH client before you're asked to verify the host's fingerprint. While the default option is to accept the fingerprint presented, you're exposed to a possible "person in the middle attack". You should always validate the host's fingerprint, which only needs to be done the first time your client connects. To obtain the host fingerprint via the portal, use the Run Command feature to execute the command:

```
Invoke-AzVMRunCommand -ResourceGroupName 'myResourceGroup' -VMName 'myVM' -CommandId 'RunPowerShellScript' -ScriptString 
'ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub | awk '{print $2}''

```
4. Success! You should now be connected to your VM. If you're unable to connect, see [Troubleshoot SSH connections](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshoot-ssh-connection).

### Password authentication

Warning

This type of authentication method is not as secure and is not our recommended way to connect.

1. Run the following command in your SSH client, where `20.51.230.13` is the public IP Address of your VM and `azureuser` is the username you created when you created the VM.

```
ssh azureuser@20.51.230.13

```

If you forgot your password or username see [Reset Access to an Azure VM](extensions/vmaccess)
