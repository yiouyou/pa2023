Several performance tests have been run on [HBv2-series](hbv2-series) size VMs. The following are some of the results of this performance testing.

| Workload | HBv2 |
| --- | --- |
| STREAM Triad | 350 GB/s (21-23 GB/s per CCX) |
| High-Performance Linpack (HPL) | 4 TeraFLOPS (Rpeak, FP64), 8 TeraFLOPS (Rmax, FP32) |
| RDMA latency & bandwidth | 1.2 microseconds, 190 Gb/s |
| FIO on local NVMe SSD | 2.7 GB/s reads, 1.1 GB/s writes; 102k IOPS reads, 115 IOPS writes |
| IOR on 8 \* Azure Premium SSD (P40 Managed Disks, RAID0)\*\* | 1.3 GB/s reads, 2.5 GB/writes; 101k IOPS reads, 105k IOPS writes |

## MPI latency

MPI latency test from the OSU microbenchmark suite is run. Sample scripts are on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azhpc-images/blob/04ddb645314a6b2b02e9edb1ea52f079241f1297/tests/run-tests.sh).

```
./bin/mpirun_rsh -np 2 -hostfile ~/hostfile MV2_CPU_MAPPING=[INSERT CORE #] ./osu_latency

```

## MPI bandwidth

MPI bandwidth test from the OSU microbenchmark suite is run. Sample scripts are on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azhpc-images/blob/04ddb645314a6b2b02e9edb1ea52f079241f1297/tests/run-tests.sh).

```
./mvapich2-2.3.install/bin/mpirun_rsh -np 2 -hostfile ~/hostfile MV2_CPU_MAPPING=[INSERT CORE #] ./mvapich2-2.3/osu_benchmarks/mpi/pt2pt/osu_bw

```

## Mellanox Perftest

The [Mellanox Perftest package](https://community.mellanox.com/s/article/perftest-package) has many InfiniBand tests such as latency (ib\_send\_lat) and bandwidth (ib\_send\_bw). An example command is below.

```
numactl --physcpubind=[INSERT CORE #]  ib_send_lat -a

```
