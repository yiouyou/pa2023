## In this article

Managed identities for Azure resources is a feature of Azure Active Directory. Each of the [Azure services that support managed identities for Azure resources](services-support-managed-identities) are subject to their own timeline. Make sure you review the [availability](services-support-managed-identities) status of managed identities for your resource and [known issues](known-issues) before you begin.

Managed identities for Azure resources provide Azure services with an automatically managed system identity in Azure Active Directory. You can use this identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, without having credentials in your code.

In this article, using CURL to make calls to the Azure Resource Manager REST endpoint, you learn how to perform the following managed identities for Azure resources operations on an Azure VM:

* Enable and disable the system-assigned managed identity on an Azure VM
* Add and remove a user-assigned managed identity on an Azure VM

If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before continuing.

## Prerequisites

* If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, see [What are managed identities for Azure resources?](overview). To learn about system-assigned and user-assigned managed identity types, see [Managed identity types](overview#managed-identity-types).

* Use the Bash environment in [Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see [Quickstart for Bash in Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).

[![](../../reusable-content/azure-cli/media/hdi-launch-cloud-shell.png)](https://shell.azure.com)
* If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally, [install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see [How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).

	+ If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the [az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see [Sign in with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).
	+ When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see [Use extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).
	+ Run [az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version) to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run [az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).

## System-assigned managed identity

In this section, you learn how to enable and disable system-assigned managed identity on an Azure VM using CURL to make calls to the Azure Resource Manager REST endpoint.

### Enable system-assigned managed identity during creation of an Azure VM

To create an Azure VM with the system-assigned managed identity enabled, your account needs the [Virtual Machine Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#virtual-machine-contributor) role assignment. No other Azure AD directory role assignments are required.

1. Create a [resource group](../../azure-resource-manager/management/overview#terminology) for containment and deployment of your VM and its related resources, using [az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group/#az-group-create). You can skip this step if you already have resource group you would like to use instead:

```
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location westus

```
2. Create a [network interface](/en-us/cli/azure/network/nic#az-network-nic-create) for your VM:

```
 az network nic create -g myResourceGroup --vnet-name myVnet --subnet mySubnet -n myNic

```
3. Retrieve a Bearer access token, which you will use in the next step in the Authorization header to create your VM with a system-assigned managed identity.

```
az account get-access-token

```
4. Using Azure Cloud Shell, create a VM using CURL to call the Azure Resource Manager REST endpoint. The following example creates a VM named *myVM* with a system-assigned managed identity, as identified in the request body by the value `"identity":{"type":"SystemAssigned"}`. Replace `<ACCESS TOKEN>` with the value you received in the previous step when you requested a Bearer access token and the `<SUBSCRIPTION ID>` value as appropriate for your environment.

```
curl 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM?api-version=2018-06-01' -X PUT -d '{"location":"westus","name":"myVM","identity":{"type":"SystemAssigned"},"properties":{"hardwareProfile":{"vmSize":"Standard_D2_v2"},"storageProfile":{"imageReference":{"sku":"2016-Datacenter","publisher":"MicrosoftWindowsServer","version":"latest","offer":"WindowsServer"},"osDisk":{"caching":"ReadWrite","managedDisk":{"storageAccountType":"StandardSSD_LRS"},"name":"myVM3osdisk","createOption":"FromImage"},"dataDisks":[{"diskSizeGB":1023,"createOption":"Empty","lun":0},{"diskSizeGB":1023,"createOption":"Empty","lun":1}]},"osProfile":{"adminUsername":"azureuser","computerName":"myVM","adminPassword":"<SECURE PASSWORD STRING>"},"networkProfile":{"networkInterfaces":[{"id":"/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/myNic","properties":{"primary":true}}]}}}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>"

### Enable system-assigned identity on an existing Azure VM

To enable system-assigned managed identity on a VM that was originally provisioned without it, your account needs the [Virtual Machine Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#virtual-machine-contributor) role assignment. No other Azure AD directory role assignments are required.

1. Retrieve a Bearer access token, which you will use in the next step in the Authorization header to create your VM with a system-assigned managed identity.

```
az account get-access-token

```
2. Use the following CURL command to call the Azure Resource Manager REST endpoint to enable system-assigned managed identity on your VM as identified in the request body by the value `{"identity":{"type":"SystemAssigned"}` for a VM named *myVM*. Replace `<ACCESS TOKEN>` with the value you received in the previous step when you requested a Bearer access token and the `<SUBSCRIPTION ID>` value as appropriate for your environment.

Important

To ensure you don't delete any existing user-assigned managed identities that are assigned to the VM, you need to list the user-assigned managed identities by using this CURL command: `curl 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<VM NAME>?api-version=2018-06-01' -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>"`. If you have any user-assigned managed identities assigned to the VM as identified in the `identity` value in the response, skip to step 3 that shows you how to retain user-assigned managed identities while enabling system-assigned managed identity on your VM.

```
curl 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM?api-version=2018-06-01' -X PATCH -d '{"identity":{"type":"SystemAssigned"}}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization:Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>"

```

```
PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM?api-version=2018-06-01 HTTP/1.1

```

**Request headers**

| Request header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *Content-Type* | Required. Set to `application/json`. |
| *Authorization* | Required. Set to a valid `Bearer` access token. |

**Request body**

```
 {  
    "identity":{  
       "type":"SystemAssigned"
    }
 }

```
3. To enable system-assigned managed identity on a VM with existing user-assigned managed identities, you need to add `SystemAssigned` to the `type` value.

For example, if your VM has the user-assigned managed identities `ID1` and `ID2` assigned to it, and you would like to add system-assigned managed identity to the VM, use the following CURL call. Replace `<ACCESS TOKEN>` and `<SUBSCRIPTION ID>` with values appropriate to your environment.

API version `2018-06-01` stores user-assigned managed identities in the `userAssignedIdentities` value in a dictionary format as opposed to the `identityIds` value in an array format used in API version `2017-12-01`.

### Disable system-assigned managed identity from an Azure VM

To disable system-assigned managed identity on a VM, your account needs the [Virtual Machine Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#virtual-machine-contributor) role assignment. No other Azure AD directory role assignments are required.

1. Retrieve a Bearer access token, which you will use in the next step in the Authorization header to create your VM with a system-assigned managed identity.

```
az account get-access-token

```
2. Update the VM using CURL to call the Azure Resource Manager REST endpoint to disable system-assigned managed identity. The following example disables system-assigned managed identity as identified in the request body by the value `{"identity":{"type":"None"}}` from a VM named *myVM*. Replace `<ACCESS TOKEN>` with the value you received in the previous step when you requested a Bearer access token and the `<SUBSCRIPTION ID>` value as appropriate for your environment.

Important

To ensure you don't delete any existing user-assigned managed identities that are assigned to the VM, you need to list the user-assigned managed identities by using this CURL command: `curl 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<VM NAME>?api-version=2018-06-01' -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>"`. If you have any user-assigned managed identities assigned to the VM as identified in the `identity` value in the response, skip to step 3 that shows you how to retain user-assigned managed identities while disabling system-assigned managed identity on your VM.

```
curl 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM?api-version=2018-06-01' -X PATCH -d '{"identity":{"type":"None"}}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization:Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>"

```

```
PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM?api-version=2018-06-01 HTTP/1.1

```

**Request headers**

| Request header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *Content-Type* | Required. Set to `application/json`. |
| *Authorization* | Required. Set to a valid `Bearer` access token. |

**Request body**

```
 {  
    "identity":{  
       "type":"None"
    }
 }

```

To remove system-assigned managed identity from a virtual machine that has user-assigned managed identities, remove `SystemAssigned` from the `{"identity":{"type:" "}}` value while keeping the `UserAssigned` value and the `userAssignedIdentities` dictionary values if you are using **API version 2018-06-01**. If you are using **API version 2017-12-01** or earlier, keep the `identityIds` array.

## User-assigned managed identity

In this section, you learn how to add and remove user-assigned managed identity on an Azure VM using CURL to make calls to the Azure Resource Manager REST endpoint.

### Assign a user-assigned managed identity during the creation of an Azure VM

To assign a user-assigned identity to a VM, your account needs the [Virtual Machine Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#virtual-machine-contributor) and [Managed Identity Operator](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#managed-identity-operator) role assignments. No other Azure AD directory role assignments are required.

1. Retrieve a Bearer access token, which you will use in the next step in the Authorization header to create your VM with a system-assigned managed identity.

```
az account get-access-token

```
2. Create a [network interface](/en-us/cli/azure/network/nic#az-network-nic-create) for your VM:

```
 az network nic create -g myResourceGroup --vnet-name myVnet --subnet mySubnet -n myNic

```
3. Retrieve a Bearer access token, which you will use in the next step in the Authorization header to create your VM with a system-assigned managed identity.

```
az account get-access-token

```
4. Create a user-assigned managed identity using the instructions found here: [Create a user-assigned managed identity](how-to-manage-ua-identity-rest#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity).
5. Create a VM using CURL to call the Azure Resource Manager REST endpoint. The following example creates a VM named *myVM* in the resource group *myResourceGroup* with a user-assigned managed identity `ID1`, as identified in the request body by the value `"identity":{"type":"UserAssigned"}`. Replace `<ACCESS TOKEN>` with the value you received in the previous step when you requested a Bearer access token and the `<SUBSCRIPTION ID>` value as appropriate for your environment.

### Assign a user-assigned managed identity to an existing Azure VM

To assign a user-assigned identity to a VM, your account needs the [Virtual Machine Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#virtual-machine-contributor) and [Managed Identity Operator](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#managed-identity-operator) role assignments. No other Azure AD directory role assignments are required.

1. Retrieve a Bearer access token, which you will use in the next step in the Authorization header to create your VM with a system-assigned managed identity.

```
az account get-access-token

```
2. Create a user-assigned managed identity using the instructions found here, [Create a user-assigned managed identity](how-to-manage-ua-identity-rest#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity).
3. To ensure you don't delete existing user or system-assigned managed identities that are assigned to the VM, you need to list the identity types assigned to the VM by using the following CURL command. If you have managed identities assigned to the virtual machine scale set, they are listed under in the `identity` value.

```
curl 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<VM NAME>?api-version=2018-06-01' -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>" 

```

```
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<VM NAME>?api-version=2018-06-01 HTTP/1.1

```

**Request headers**

| Request header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *Authorization* | Required. Set to a valid `Bearer` access token. |

If you have any user or system-assigned managed identities assigned to the VM as identified in the `identity` value in the response, skip to step 5 that shows you how to retain the system-assigned managed identity while adding a user-assigned managed identity on your VM.
4. If you don't have any user-assigned managed identities assigned to your VM, use the following CURL command to call the Azure Resource Manager REST endpoint to assign the first user-assigned managed identity to the VM.

The following example assigns a user-assigned managed identity, `ID1` to a VM named *myVM* in the resource group *myResourceGroup*. Replace `<ACCESS TOKEN>` with the value you received in the previous step when you requested a Bearer access token and the `<SUBSCRIPTION ID>` value as appropriate for your environment.

          },
          "/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/ID2":{

          }
       }
    }
 }

```

**API VERSION 2017-12-01**

Retain the user-assigned managed identities you would like to keep in the `identityIds` array value while adding the new user-assigned managed identity.

For example, if you have system-assigned managed identity and the user-assigned managed identity `ID1` currently assigned to your VM and would like to add the user-assigned managed identity `ID2` to it:

```

### Remove a user-assigned managed identity from an Azure VM

To remove a user-assigned identity to a VM, your account needs the [Virtual Machine Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#virtual-machine-contributor) role assignment.

1. Retrieve a Bearer access token, which you will use in the next step in the Authorization header to create your VM with a system-assigned managed identity.

```
az account get-access-token

```
2. To ensure you don't delete any existing user-assigned managed identities that you would like to keep assigned to the VM or remove the system-assigned managed identity, you need to list the managed identities by using the following CURL command:

```
curl 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<VM NAME>?api-version=2018-06-01' -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>"

```

```
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<VM NAME>?api-version=2018-06-01 HTTP/1.1

```

**Request headers**

| Request header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *Content-Type* | Required. Set to `application/json`. |
| *Authorization* | Required. Set to a valid `Bearer` access token. |

If you have managed identities assigned to the VM, they are listed in the response in the `identity` value.

For example, if you have user-assigned managed identities `ID1` and `ID2` assigned to your VM, and you only want to keep `ID1` assigned and retain the system-assigned identity:

**API VERSION 2018-06-01**

Add `null` to the user-assigned managed identity you would like to remove:

```
curl 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM?api-version=2018-06-01' -X PATCH -d '{"identity":{"type":"SystemAssigned, UserAssigned", "userAssignedIdentities":{"/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/ID2":null}}}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization:Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>"

```

```
PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM?api-version=2018-06-01 HTTP/1.1

```

**Request headers**

| Request header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *Content-Type* | Required. Set to `application/json`. |
| *Authorization* | Required. Set to a valid `Bearer` access token. |

**Request body**

```
 {
    "identity":{
       "type":"SystemAssigned, UserAssigned",
       "userAssignedIdentities":{
          "/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/ID2":null
       }
    }
 }

```

**API VERSION 2017-12-01**

Retain only the user-assigned managed identity(s) you would like to keep in the `identityIds` array:

```
curl 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM?api-version=2017-12-01' -X PATCH -d '{"identity":{"type":"SystemAssigned, UserAssigned", "identityIds":["/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/ID1"]}}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization:Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>"

```

```
PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM?api-version=2017-12-01 HTTP/1.1

```

**Request headers**

| Request header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *Content-Type* | Required. Set to `application/json`. |
| *Authorization* | Required. Set to a valid `Bearer` access token. |

**Request body**

```
 {
    "identity":{
       "type":"SystemAssigned, UserAssigned",
       "identityIds":[
          "/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/ID1"
       ]
    }
 }

```

If your VM has both system-assigned and user-assigned managed identities, you can remove all the user-assigned managed identities by switching to use only system-assigned managed identity using the following command:

```
curl 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM?api-version=2018-06-01' -X PATCH -d '{"identity":{"type":"SystemAssigned"}}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization:Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>"

```

```
PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM?api-version=2018-06-01 HTTP/1.1

```

**Request headers**

| Request header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *Content-Type* | Required. Set to `application/json`. |
| *Authorization* | Required. Set to a valid `Bearer` access token. |

**Request body**

```
{
   "identity":{
      "type":"SystemAssigned"
   }
}

```

If your VM has only user-assigned managed identities and you would like to remove them all, use the following command:

```
curl 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM?api-version=2018-06-01' -X PATCH -d '{"identity":{"type":"None"}}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H Authorization:"Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>"

```

```
PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM?api-version=2018-06-01 HTTP/1.1

```

**Request headers**

| Request header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *Content-Type* | Required. Set to `application/json`. |
| *Authorization* | Required. Set to a valid `Bearer` access token. |

**Request body**

```
{
   "identity":{
      "type":"None"
   }
}

```
