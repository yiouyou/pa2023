The Dlsv5 and Dldsv5-series Virtual Machines runs on the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor in a [hyper threaded](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html) configuration. This new processor features an all core turbo clock speed of 3.5 GHz with [IntelÂ® Turbo Boost Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [IntelÂ® Advanced-Vector Extensions 512 (IntelÂ® AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html) and [IntelÂ® Deep Learning Boost](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai/deep-learning-boost.html). The Dlsv5 and Dldsv5 VM series provides 2GiBs of RAM per vCPU and optimized for workloads that require less RAM per vCPU than standard VM sizes. Target workloads include web servers, gaming, video encoding, AI/ML, and batch processing.

## Dlsv5-series

Dlsv5-series virtual machines run on the 3rd Generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor reaching an all core turbo clock speed of up to 3.5 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 96 vCPU and 192 GiB of RAM. These VM sizes can reduce cost when running non-memory intensive applications.

Dlsv5-series virtual machines do not have any temporary storage thus lowering the price of entry. You can attach Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. [See pricing for disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/).

## Dldsv5-series

Dldsv5-series virtual machines run on the 3rd Generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor reaching an all core turbo clock speed of up to 3.5 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 96 vCPU and 192 GiB of RAM as well as fast, local SSD storage up to 3,600 GiB. These VM sizes can reduce cost when running non-memory intensive applications.

Dldsv5-series virtual machines support Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability.

1 Accelerated networking is required and turned on by default on all Dldsv5 virtual machines.  

2 Dldsv5-series virtual machines can [burst](disk-bursting) their disk performance and get up to their bursting max for up to 30 minutes at a time.

## Size table definitions

* Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
* Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
* Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **ReadOnly** or **ReadWrite**. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **None**.
* To learn how to get the best storage performance for your VMs, see [Virtual machine and disk performance](disks-performance).
* **Expected network bandwidth** is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, see [Virtual machine network bandwidth](../virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput).

Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, see [Optimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines](../virtual-network/virtual-network-optimize-network-bandwidth). To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, see [Bandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP)](../virtual-network/virtual-network-bandwidth-testing).
