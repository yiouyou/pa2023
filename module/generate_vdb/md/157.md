Tip

Try the **[Virtual machines selector tool](https://aka.ms/vm-selector)** to find other sizes that best fit your workload.

This section provides information on previous generations of virtual machine sizes. These sizes can still be used, but there are newer generations available.

## F-series

F-series is based on the 2.4 GHz Intel XeonÂ® E5-2673 v3 (Haswell) processor, which can achieve clock speeds as high as 3.1 GHz with the Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0. This is the same CPU performance as the Dv2-series of VMs.

F-series VMs are an excellent choice for workloads that demand faster CPUs but do not need as much memory or temporary storage per vCPU. Workloads such as analytics, gaming servers, web servers, and batch processing will benefit from the value of the F-series.

1 The maximum disk throughput (IOPS or MBps) possible with a Fs series VM may be limited by the number, size, and striping of the attached disk(s). For details, see [Design for high performance](premium-storage-performance).

## NVv2-series

**Newer size recommendation**: [NVv3-series](nvv3-series)

The NVv2-series virtual machines are powered by [NVIDIA Tesla M60](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tesla/pdf/188417-Tesla-M60-DS-A4-fnl-Web.pdf) GPUs and NVIDIA GRID technology with Intel Broadwell CPUs. These virtual machines are targeted for GPU accelerated graphics applications and virtual desktops where customers want to visualize their data, simulate results to view, work on CAD, or render and stream content. Additionally, these virtual machines can run single precision workloads such as encoding and rendering. NVv2 virtual machines support Premium Storage and come with twice the system memory (RAM) when compared with its predecessor NV-series.

Each GPU in NVv2 instances comes with a GRID license. This license gives you the flexibility to use an NV instance as a virtual workstation for a single user, or 25 concurrent users can connect to the VM for a virtual application scenario.

[Ephemeral OS Disks](ephemeral-os-disks): Supported

## Older generations of virtual machine sizes

This section provides information on older generations of virtual machine sizes. These sizes are still supported but will not receive additional capacity. There are newer or alternative sizes that are generally available. Please refer to [Sizes virtual machines in Azure](sizes) to choose the VM sizes that will best fit your need.

For more information on resizing a Linux VM, see [Resize a VM](resize-vm).

ACU: 225

Premium Storage: Not Supported

Premium Storage caching: Not Supported

The A8-A11 and H-series sizes are also known as *compute-intensive instances*. The hardware that runs these sizes is designed and optimized for compute-intensive and network-intensive applications, including high-performance computing (HPC) cluster applications, modeling, and simulations. The A8-A11 series uses Intel Xeon E5-2670 @ 2.6 GHZ and the H-series uses Intel Xeon E5-2667 v3 @ 3.2 GHz.

1 For MPI applications, dedicated RDMA backend network is enabled by FDR InfiniBand network, which delivers ultra-low-latency and high bandwidth.

Note

The [A8 â A11 VMs are planned for retirement on 3/2021](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/a8-a11-azure-virtual-machine-sizes-will-be-retired-on-march-1-2021/). We strongly recommend not creating any new A8 â A11 VMs. Please migrate any existing A8 â A11 VMs to newer and powerful high-performance computing VM sizes such as H, HB, HC, HBv2 as well as general purpose compute VM sizes such as D, E, and F for better price-performance.

### Ls-series

**Newer size recommendation**: [Lsv2-series](lsv2-series)

The Ls-series offers up to 32 vCPUs, using the [IntelÂ® XeonÂ® processor E5 v3 family](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/xeon/xeon-e5-solutions.html). The Ls-series gets the same CPU performance as the G/GS-Series and comes with 8 GiB of memory per vCPU.

The Ls-series does not support the creation of a local cache to increase the IOPS achievable by durable data disks. The high throughput and IOPS of the local disk makes Ls-series VMs ideal for NoSQL stores such as Apache Cassandra and MongoDB which replicate data across multiple VMs to achieve persistence in the event of the failure of a single VM.

### NCv2 series

**Newer size recommendation**: [NC T4 v3-series](nct4-v3-series) and [NC V100 v3-series](ncv3-series)

NCv2-series VMs are powered by NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs. These GPUs can provide more than 2x the computational performance of the NC-series. Customers can take advantage of these updated GPUs for traditional HPC workloads such as reservoir modeling, DNA sequencing, protein analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, and others. In addition to the GPUs, the NCv2-series VMs are also powered by Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 (Broadwell) CPUs.

The NC24rs v2 configuration provides a low latency, high-throughput network interface optimized for tightly coupled parallel computing workloads.

### ND series

**Newer size recommendation**: [NDv2-series](ndv2-series) and [NC V100 v3-series](ncv3-series)

The ND-series virtual machines are a new addition to the GPU family designed for AI, and Deep Learning workloads. They offer excellent performance for training and inference. ND instances are powered by [NVIDIA Tesla P40](https://images.nvidia.com/content/pdf/tesla/184427-Tesla-P40-Datasheet-NV-Final-Letter-Web.pdf) GPUs and Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 (Broadwell) CPUs. These instances provide excellent performance for single-precision floating point operations, for AI workloads utilizing Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, TensorFlow, Caffe, and other frameworks. The ND-series also offers a much larger GPU memory size (24 GB), enabling to fit much larger neural net models. Like the NC-series, the ND-series offers a configuration with a secondary low-latency, high-throughput network through RDMA, and InfiniBand connectivity so you can run large-scale training jobs spanning many GPUs.
