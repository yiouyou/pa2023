## In this article

This script creates a virtual machine by attaching an existing managed disk as OS disk. Use this script in preceding scenarios:

* Create a VM from an existing managed OS disk that was copied from a managed disk in different subscription
* Create a VM from an existing managed disk that was created from a specialized VHD file
* Create a VM from an existing managed OS disk that was created from a snapshot

If you don't have an [Azure subscription](../../guides/developer/azure-developer-guide#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing), create an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

* Use the Bash environment in [Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see [Quickstart for Bash in Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).

[![](../../reusable-content/azure-cli/media/hdi-launch-cloud-shell.png)](https://shell.azure.com)
* If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally, [install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see [How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).

	+ If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the [az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see [Sign in with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).
	+ When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see [Use extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).
	+ Run [az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version) to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run [az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).

## Sample script

### Launch Azure Cloud Shell

The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell that you can use to run the steps in this article. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account.

To open the Cloud Shell, just select **Try it** from the upper right corner of a code block. You can also launch Cloud Shell in a separate browser tab by going to <https://shell.azure.com>.

When Cloud Shell opens, verify that **Bash** is selected for your environment. Subsequent sessions will use Azure CLI in a Bash environment, Select **Copy** to copy the blocks of code, paste it into the Cloud Shell, and press **Enter** to run it.

### Sign in to Azure

Cloud Shell is automatically authenticated under the initial account signed-in with. Use the following script to sign in using a different subscription, replacing `<Subscription ID>` with your Azure Subscription ID. If you don't have an [Azure subscription](../../guides/developer/azure-developer-guide#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing), create an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.

```
subscription="<subscriptionId>" # add subscription here

az account set -s $subscription # ...or use 'az login'

```

For more information, see [set active subscription](/en-us/cli/azure/account#az-account-set) or [log in interactively](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login)

### Run the script

```

#Provide the subscription Id
subscriptionId="<subscriptionId>"

#Provide the name of your resource group
resourceGroupName=myResourceGroupName

#Provide the name of the Managed Disk
managedDiskName=myDiskName

#Provide the OS type
osType=linux

#Provide the name of the virtual machine
virtualMachineName=myVirtualMachineName123

#Set the context to the subscription Id where Managed Disk exists and where VM will be created
az account set --subscription $subscriptionId

#Get the resource Id of the managed disk
managedDiskId=$(az disk show --name $managedDiskName --resource-group $resourceGroupName --query [id] -o tsv)

#Create VM by attaching existing managed disks as OS
az vm create --name $virtualMachineName --resource-group $resourceGroupName --attach-os-disk $managedDiskId --os-type $osType

```

## Clean up resources

Run the following command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources.

```
az group delete --name myResourceGroupName

```

## Sample reference

This script uses the following commands to get managed disk properties, attach a managed disk to a new VM and create a VM. Each item in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| [az disk show](/en-us/cli/azure/disk) | Gets managed disk properties using disk name and resource group name. Id property is used to attach a managed disk to a new VM |
| [az vm create](/en-us/cli/azure/vm) | Creates a VM using a managed OS disk |

## Next steps

For more information on the Azure CLI, see [Azure CLI documentation](/en-us/cli/azure).
