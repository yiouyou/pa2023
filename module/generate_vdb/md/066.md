The Dv3-series run on the 3rd Generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake), IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake), IntelÂ® XeonÂ® 8171M 2.1GHz (Skylake), IntelÂ® XeonÂ® E5-2673 v4 2.3 GHz (Broadwell), or the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® E5-2673 v3 2.4 GHz (Haswell) processors in a hyper-threaded configuration, providing a better value proposition for most general purpose workloads. Memory has been expanded (from ~3.5 GiB/vCPU to 4 GiB/vCPU) while disk and network limits have been adjusted on a per core basis to align with the move to hyperthreading. The Dv3-series no longer has the high memory VM sizes of the D/Dv2-series, those have been moved to the memory optimized [Ev3 and Esv3-series](ev3-esv3-series).

Example D-series use cases include enterprise-grade applications, relational databases, in-memory caching, and analytics.

## Dv3-series

Dv3-series sizes run on the 3rd Generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake), IntelÂ® XeonÂ® Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake), IntelÂ® XeonÂ® 8171M 2.1GHz (Skylake), IntelÂ® XeonÂ® E5-2673 v4 2.3 GHz (Broadwell), or the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® E5-2673 v3 2.4 GHz (Haswell) processors with [IntelÂ® Turbo Boost Technology 2.0](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html). The Dv3-series sizes offer a combination of vCPU, memory, and temporary storage for most production workloads.

Data disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. To use premium storage disks, use the Dsv3 sizes. The pricing and billing meters for Dsv3 sizes are the same as Dv3-series.

Dv3-series VMs feature IntelÂ® Hyper-Threading Technology.

1 Dsv3-series VMs can [burst](disk-bursting) their disk performance and get up to their bursting max for up to 30 minutes at a time.  

2 Accelerated networking can only be applied to a single NIC.

## Size table definitions

* Storage capacity is shown in units of GiB or 1024^3 bytes. When you compare disks measured in GB (1000^3 bytes) to disks measured in GiB (1024^3) remember that capacity numbers given in GiB may appear smaller. For example, 1023 GiB = 1098.4 GB.
* Disk throughput is measured in input/output operations per second (IOPS) and MBps where MBps = 10^6 bytes/sec.
* Data disks can operate in cached or uncached modes. For cached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **ReadOnly** or **ReadWrite**. For uncached data disk operation, the host cache mode is set to **None**.
* To learn how to get the best storage performance for your VMs, see [Virtual machine and disk performance](disks-performance).
* **Expected network bandwidth** is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, see [Virtual machine network bandwidth](../virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput).

Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance will depend on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, see [Optimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines](../virtual-network/virtual-network-optimize-network-bandwidth). To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, see [Bandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP)](../virtual-network/virtual-network-bandwidth-testing).
