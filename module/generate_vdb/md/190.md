**Applies to:** âï¸ Windows VMs

You can use Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 10 Enterprise (x64) in Azure for dev/test scenarios provided you have an appropriate Visual Studio (formerly MSDN) subscription.

To run Windows 10 in a production environment see, [How to deploy Windows 10 on Azure with Multitenant Hosting Rights](windows-desktop-multitenant-hosting-deployment).

## Subscription eligibility

Active Visual Studio subscribers (people who have acquired a Visual Studio subscription license) can use Windows client images for development and testing purposes. Windows client images can be used on your own hardware or on Azure virtual machines.

Certain Windows client images are available from the Azure Marketplace. Visual Studio subscribers within any type of offer can also [prepare and create](prepare-for-upload-vhd-image) 64-bit Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 10 images and then [upload to Azure](upload-generalized-managed).

## Eligible offers and client images

The following table details the offer IDs that are eligible to deploy Windows client images through the Azure Marketplace. The Windows client images are only visible to the following offers.

Note

Image offers are under **Windows Client** in the Azure Marketplace. Use **Windows Client** when searching for client images available to Visual Studio subscribers. If you need to purchase a Visual Studio subscription, see the various options at [Buy Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/?tab=business)
