Azure Disk Storage allows you to manage your own keys when using server-side encryption (SSE) for managed disks, if you choose. For conceptual information on SSE with customer managed keys, as well as other managed disk encryption types, see the [Customer-managed keys](../disk-encryption#customer-managed-keys) section of our disk encryption article.

## Restrictions

For now, customer-managed keys have the following restrictions:

* If this feature is enabled for a disk with incremental snapshots, it can't be disabled on that disk or its snapshots.
To work around this, copy all the data to an entirely different managed disk that isn't using customer-managed keys. You can do that with either the [Azure CLI](disks-upload-vhd-to-managed-disk-cli#copy-a-managed-disk) or the [Azure PowerShell module](../windows/disks-upload-vhd-to-managed-disk-powershell#copy-a-managed-disk).
* Only [software and HSM RSA keys](../../key-vault/keys/about-keys) of sizes 2,048-bit, 3,072-bit and 4,096-bit are supported, no other keys or sizes.
	+ [HSM](../../key-vault/keys/hsm-protected-keys) keys require the **premium** tier of Azure Key vaults.
* For Ultra Disks and Premium SSD v2 disks only: Snapshots created from disks that are encrypted with server-side encryption and customer-managed keys must be encrypted with the same customer-managed keys.
* Most resources related to your customer-managed keys (disk encryption sets, VMs, disks, and snapshots) must be in the same subscription and region.
	+ Azure Key Vaults may be used from a different subscription but must be in the same region as your disk encryption set. As a preview, you can use Azure Key Vaults from [different Azure Active Directory tenants](../disks-cross-tenant-customer-managed-keys).
* Disks encrypted with customer-managed keys can only move to another resource group if the VM they are attached to is deallocated.
* Disks, snapshots, and images encrypted with customer-managed keys can't be moved between subscriptions.
* Managed disks currently or previously encrypted using Azure Disk Encryption can't be encrypted using customer-managed keys.
* Can only create up to 5000 disk encryption sets per region per subscription.
* For information about using customer-managed keys with shared image galleries, see [Preview: Use customer-managed keys for encrypting images](../image-version-encryption).

## Create resources

Once the feature is enabled, you'll need to set up a DiskEncryptionSet and either an [Azure Key Vault](../../key-vault/general/overview) or an [Azure Key Vault Managed HSM](../../key-vault/managed-hsm/overview).

### Azure Key Vault

* Install the latest [Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-az-cli2) and log to an Azure account in with [az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index).
* Create an Azure Key Vault and encryption key.

When creating the Key Vault, you must enable purge protection. Purge protection ensures that a deleted key cannot be permanently deleted until the retention period lapses. These settings protect you from losing data due to accidental deletion. These settings are mandatory when using a Key Vault for encrypting managed disks.

Important

Don't camel case the region, if you do so, you may experience problems when assigning additional disks to the resource in the Azure portal.

```
subscriptionId=yourSubscriptionID
rgName=yourResourceGroupName
location=westcentralus
keyVaultName=yourKeyVaultName
keyName=yourKeyName
diskEncryptionSetName=yourDiskEncryptionSetName
diskName=yourDiskName

az account set --subscription $subscriptionId

az group create --resource-group $rgName --location $location

az keyvault create -n $keyVaultName \
-g $rgName \
-l $location \
--enable-purge-protection true 

az keyvault key create --vault-name $keyVaultName \
-n $keyName \
--protection software

```

* Create a DiskEncryptionSet. You can set enable-auto-key-rotation equal to true to enable automatic rotation of the key. When you enable automatic rotation, the system will automatically update all managed disks, snapshots, and images referencing the disk encryption set to use the new version of the key within one hour.

```
keyVaultKeyUrl=$(az keyvault key show --vault-name $keyVaultName --name $keyName --query [key.kid] -o tsv)

az disk-encryption-set create -n $diskEncryptionSetName \
-l $location \
-g $rgName \
--key-url $keyVaultKeyUrl \
--enable-auto-key-rotation false

```

* Grant the DiskEncryptionSet resource access to the key vault.

Note

It may take few minutes for Azure to create the identity of your DiskEncryptionSet in your Azure Active Directory. If you get an error like "Cannot find the Active Directory object" when running the following command, wait a few minutes and try again.

```
desIdentity=$(az disk-encryption-set show -n $diskEncryptionSetName -g $rgName --query [identity.principalId] -o tsv)

az keyvault set-policy -n $keyVaultName \
-g $rgName \
--object-id $desIdentity \
--key-permissions wrapkey unwrapkey get

```

### Azure Key Vault Managed HSM

Alternatively, you can use a Managed HSM to handle your keys.

To do this, you must complete the following prerequisites:

* Install the latest [Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-az-cli2) and log in to an Azure account in with [az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index).
* [Create and configure a managed HSM](../../key-vault/managed-hsm/quick-create-cli).
* [Assign permissions to a user, so they can manage your Managed HSM](../../key-vault/managed-hsm/role-management).

#### Configuration

Once you've created a Managed HSM and added permissions, enable purge protection and create an encryption key.

```
subscriptionId=yourSubscriptionID
rgName=yourResourceGroupName
location=westcentralus
keyVaultName=yourKeyVaultName
keyName=yourKeyName
diskEncryptionSetName=yourDiskEncryptionSetName
diskName=yourDiskName

az account set --subscription $subscriptionId

az keyvault update-hsm --subscription $subscriptionId -g $rgName --hsm-name $keyVaultName --enable-purge-protection true

az keyvault key create --hsm-name  $keyVaultName --name $keyName --ops wrapKey unwrapKey --kty RSA-HSM --size 2048

```

Then, create a DiskEncryptionSet.

```
keyVaultKeyUrl=$(az keyvault key show --vault-name $keyVaultName --name $keyName --query [key.kid] -o tsv)

az disk-encryption-set create -n $diskEncryptionSetName \
-l $location \
-g $rgName \
--key-url $keyVaultKeyUrl \
--enable-auto-key-rotation false

```

Finally, grant the DiskEncryptionSet access to the Managed HSM.

```
desIdentity=$(az disk-encryption-set show -n $diskEncryptionSetName -g $rgName --query [identity.principalId] -o tsv)

az keyvault role assignment create --hsm-name $keyVaultName --role "Managed HSM Crypto Service Encryption User" --assignee $desIdentity --scope /keys

```

Now that you've created and configured these resources, you can use them to secure your managed disks. The following links contain example scripts, each with a respective scenario, that you can use to secure your managed disks.

## Examples

### Create a VM using a Marketplace image, encrypting the OS and data disks with customer-managed keys

```
rgName=yourResourceGroupName
vmName=yourVMName
location=westcentralus
vmSize=Standard_DS3_V2
image=LinuxImageURN 
diskEncryptionSetName=yourDiskencryptionSetName

diskEncryptionSetId=$(az disk-encryption-set show -n $diskEncryptionSetName -g $rgName --query [id] -o tsv)

az vm create -g $rgName -n $vmName -l $location --image $image --size $vmSize --generate-ssh-keys --os-disk-encryption-set $diskEncryptionSetId --data-disk-sizes-gb 128 128 --data-disk-encryption-sets $diskEncryptionSetId $diskEncryptionSetId

```

### Encrypt existing managed disks

Your existing disks must not be attached to a running VM in order for you to encrypt them using the following script:

```
rgName=yourResourceGroupName
diskName=yourDiskName
diskEncryptionSetName=yourDiskEncryptionSetName

az disk update -n $diskName -g $rgName --encryption-type EncryptionAtRestWithCustomerKey --disk-encryption-set $diskEncryptionSetId

```

### Create a virtual machine scale set using a Marketplace image, encrypting the OS and data disks with customer-managed keys

```
rgName=yourResourceGroupName
vmssName=yourVMSSName
location=westcentralus
vmSize=Standard_DS3_V2
image=LinuxImageURN 
diskEncryptionSetName=yourDiskencryptionSetName

diskEncryptionSetId=$(az disk-encryption-set show -n $diskEncryptionSetName -g $rgName --query [id] -o tsv)
az vmss create -g $rgName -n $vmssName --image $image --upgrade-policy automatic --admin-username azureuser --generate-ssh-keys --os-disk-encryption-set $diskEncryptionSetId --data-disk-sizes-gb 64 128 --data-disk-encryption-sets $diskEncryptionSetId $diskEncryptionSetId

```

### Create an empty disk encrypted using server-side encryption with customer-managed keys and attach it to a VM

```
vmName=yourVMName
rgName=yourResourceGroupName
diskName=yourDiskName
diskSkuName=Premium_LRS
diskSizeinGiB=30
location=westcentralus
diskLUN=2
diskEncryptionSetName=yourDiskEncryptionSetName

diskEncryptionSetId=$(az disk-encryption-set show -n $diskEncryptionSetName -g $rgName --query [id] -o tsv)

az disk create -n $diskName -g $rgName -l $location --encryption-type EncryptionAtRestWithCustomerKey --disk-encryption-set $diskEncryptionSetId --size-gb $diskSizeinGiB --sku $diskSkuName

diskId=$(az disk show -n $diskName -g $rgName --query [id] -o tsv)

az vm disk attach --vm-name $vmName --lun $diskLUN --ids $diskId 

```

### Change the key of a DiskEncryptionSet to rotate the key for all the resources referencing the DiskEncryptionSet

```

rgName=yourResourceGroupName
keyVaultName=yourKeyVaultName
keyName=yourKeyName
diskEncryptionSetName=yourDiskEncryptionSetName

keyVaultId=$(az keyvault show --name $keyVaultName--query [id] -o tsv)

keyVaultKeyUrl=$(az keyvault key show --vault-name $keyVaultName --name $keyName --query [key.kid] -o tsv)

az disk-encryption-set update -n keyrotationdes -g keyrotationtesting --key-url $keyVaultKeyUrl --source-vault $keyVaultId

```

### Find the status of server-side encryption of a disk

```
az disk show -g yourResourceGroupName -n yourDiskName --query [encryption.type] -o tsv

```

Important

Customer-managed keys rely on managed identities for Azure resources, a feature of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you configure customer-managed keys, a managed identity is automatically assigned to your resources under the covers. If you subsequently move the subscription, resource group, or managed disk from one Azure AD directory to another, the managed identity associated with the managed disks is not transferred to the new tenant, so customer-managed keys may no longer work. For more information, see [Transferring a subscription between Azure AD directories](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/known-issues#transferring-a-subscription-between-azure-ad-directories).
