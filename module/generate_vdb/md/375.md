Note

We recommend that customers choose [virtual machine scale sets with flexible orchestration mode](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview) for high availability with the widest range of features. Virtual machine scale sets allow VM instances to be centrally managed, configured, and updated, and will automatically increase or decrease the number of VM instances in response to demand or a defined schedule. Availability sets only offer high availability.

This article provides you with an overview of the availability features of Azure virtual machines (VMs).

## What is an availability set?

An availability set is a logical grouping of VMs that allows Azure to understand how your application is built to provide for redundancy and availability. We recommended that two or more VMs are created within an availability set to provide for a highly available application and to meet the [99.95% Azure SLA](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/virtual-machines/). There is no cost for the Availability Set itself, you only pay for each VM instance that you create.

## How do availability sets work?

Each virtual machine in your availability set is assigned an **update domain** and a **fault domain** by the underlying Azure platform. Each availability set can be configured with up to three fault domains and twenty update domains. These configurations can't be changed once the availability set has been created. Update domains indicate groups of virtual machines and underlying physical hardware that can be rebooted at the same time. When more than five virtual machines are configured within a single availability set with five update domains, the sixth virtual machine is placed into the same update domain as the first virtual machine, the seventh in the same update domain as the second virtual machine, and so on. The order of update domains being rebooted may not proceed sequentially during planned maintenance, but only one update domain is rebooted at a time. A rebooted update domain is given 30 minutes to recover before maintenance is initiated on a different update domain.

Fault domains define the group of virtual machines that share a common power source and network switch. By default, the virtual machines configured within your availability set are separated across up to three fault domains. While placing your virtual machines into an availability set doesn't protect your application from operating system or application-specific failures, it does limit the impact of potential physical hardware failures, network outages, or power interruptions.

VMs are also aligned with disk fault domains. This alignment ensures that all the managed disks attached to a VM are within the same fault domains.

Only VMs with managed disks can be created in a managed availability set. The number of managed disk fault domains varies by region - either two or three managed disk fault domains per region. The following command will retreive a list of fault domains per region:

```
az vm list-skus --resource-type availabilitySets --query '[?name==`Aligned`].{Location:locationInfo[0].location, MaximumFaultDomainCount:capabilities[0].value}' -o Table

```

Under certain circumstances, two VMs in the same availability set might share a fault domain. You can confirm a shared fault domain by going to your availability set and checking the Fault Domain column. A shared fault domain might be caused by the completing following sequence when you deployed the VMs:

1. Deploy the first VM.
2. Stop/deallocate the first VM.
3. Deploy the second VM.

Under these circumstances, the OS disk of the second VM might be created on the same fault domain as the first VM, so the two VMs will be on same fault domain. To avoid this issue, we recommend that you don't stop/deallocate VMs between deployments.
