## In this article

A virtual machine (VM) is automatically assigned a private IP address from a range that you specify. This range is based on the subnet in which the VM is deployed. The VM keeps the address until the VM is deleted. Azure dynamically assigns the next available private IP address from the subnet you create a VM in. Assign a static IP address to the VM if you want a specific IP address in the subnet.

## Prerequisites

* Use the Bash environment in [Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see [Quickstart for Bash in Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).

[![](../../reusable-content/azure-cli/media/hdi-launch-cloud-shell.png)](https://shell.azure.com)
* If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally, [install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see [How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).

	+ If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the [az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see [Sign in with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).
	+ When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see [Use extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).
	+ Run [az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version) to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run [az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* This tutorial requires version 2.0.28 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Create a resource group

An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

Create a resource group with [az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) named **myResourceGroup** in the **eastus2** location.

```
  az group create \
    --name myResourceGroup \
    --location eastus2

```

## Create a virtual machine

Create a virtual machine with [az vm create](/en-us/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-create).

The following command creates a Windows Server virtual machine. When prompted, provide a username and password to be used as the credentials for the virtual machine:

```
  az vm create \
    --name myVM \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --public-ip-address myPublicIP \
    --public-ip-sku Standard \
    --image MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServer:2019-Datacenter:latest \
    --admin-username azureuser

```

## Change private IP address to static

In this section, you'll change the private IP address from **dynamic** to **static** for the virtual machine you created previously.

Use [az network nic ip-config update](/en-us/cli/azure/network/nic/ip-config#az-network-nic-ip-config-update) to update the network interface configuration.

The following command changes the private IP address of the virtual machine to static:

```
  az network nic ip-config update \
    --name ipconfigmyVM \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --nic-name myVMVMNic \
    --private-ip-address 10.0.0.4

```

Warning

From within the operating system of a VM, you shouldn't statically assign the *private* IP that's assigned to the Azure VM. Only do static assignment of a private IP when it's necessary, such as when [assigning many IP addresses to VMs](virtual-network-multiple-ip-addresses-portal).

If you manually set the private IP address within the operating system, make sure it matches the private IP address assigned to the Azure [network interface](virtual-network-network-interface-addresses#change-ip-address-settings). Otherwise, you can lose connectivity to the VM. Learn more about [private IP address](virtual-network-network-interface-addresses#private) settings.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use [az group delete](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) to remove the resource group and all of the resources it contains:

```
  az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes

```
