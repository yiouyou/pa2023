**Applies to:** âï¸ Linux VMs âï¸ Windows VMs âï¸ Flexible scale sets âï¸ Uniform scale sets

This article describes the available sizes and options for the Azure virtual machines you can use to run your apps and workloads. It also provides deployment considerations to be aware of when you're planning to use these resources.

Tip

Try the **[Virtual machines selector tool](https://aka.ms/vm-selector)** to find other sizes that best fit your workload.

| Type | Sizes | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [General purpose](sizes-general) | B, Dsv3, Dv3, Dasv4, Dav4, DSv2, Dv2, Av2, DC, DCv2, Dpdsv5, Dpldsv5, Dpsv5, Dplsv5, Dv4, Dsv4, Ddv4, Ddsv4, Dv5, Dsv5, Ddv5, Ddsv5, Dasv5, Dadsv5 | Balanced CPU-to-memory ratio. Ideal for testing and development, small to medium databases, and low to medium traffic web servers. |
| [Compute optimized](sizes-compute) | F, Fs, Fsv2, FX | High CPU-to-memory ratio. Good for medium traffic web servers, network appliances, batch processes, and application servers. |
| [Memory optimized](sizes-memory) | Esv3, Ev3, Easv4, Eav4, Epdsv5, Epsv5, Ev4, Esv4, Edv4, Edsv4, Ev5, Esv5, Edv5, Edsv5, Easv5, Eadsv5, Mv2, M, DSv2, Dv2 | High memory-to-CPU ratio. Great for relational database servers, medium to large caches, and in-memory analytics. |
| [Storage optimized](sizes-storage) | Lsv2, Lsv3, Lasv3 | High disk throughput and IO ideal for Big Data, SQL, NoSQL databases, data warehousing and large transactional databases. |
| [GPU](sizes-gpu) | NC, NCv2, NCv3, NCasT4\_v3, NC A100 v4, ND, NDv2, NGads V620, NV, NVv3, NVv4, NDasrA100\_v4, NDm\_A100\_v4 | Specialized virtual machines targeted for heavy graphic rendering and video editing, as well as model training and inferencing (ND) with deep learning. Available with single or multiple GPUs. |
| [High performance compute](sizes-hpc) | HB, HBv2, HBv3, HBv4, HC, HX | Our fastest and most powerful CPU virtual machines with optional high-throughput network interfaces (RDMA). |

Learn more about how [Azure compute units (ACU)](acu) can help you compare compute performance across Azure SKUs.

## Benchmark scores

Learn more about compute performance for Linux VMs using the [CoreMark benchmark scores](linux/compute-benchmark-scores).

Learn more about compute performance for Windows VMs using the [SPECInt benchmark scores](windows/compute-benchmark-scores).

## Manage costs

Azure services cost money. Azure Cost Management helps you set budgets and configure alerts to keep spending under control. Analyze, manage, and optimize your Azure costs with Cost Management. To learn more, see the [quickstart on analyzing your costs](../cost-management-billing/costs/quick-acm-cost-analysis?WT.mc_id=costmanagementcontent_docsacmhorizontal_-inproduct-learn).
