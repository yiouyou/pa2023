Each virtual machine (VM) in Azure is created from an image that defines the Linux distribution and OS version. Images can include pre-installed applications and configurations. The Azure Marketplace provides many first and third-party images for most common distributions and application environments, or you can create your own custom images tailored to your needs. This article details how to use the open source tool [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) to define and build custom images in Azure.

Note

Azure now has a service, Azure Image Builder, for defining and creating your own custom images. Azure Image Builder is built on Packer, so you can even use your existing Packer shell provisioner scripts with it. To get started with Azure Image Builder, see [Create a Linux VM with Azure Image Builder](image-builder).

## Create Azure resource group

During the build process, Packer creates temporary Azure resources as it builds the source VM. To capture that source VM for use as an image, you must define a resource group. The output from the Packer build process is stored in this resource group.

Create a resource group with [az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group). The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location:

```
az group create -n myResourceGroup -l eastus

```

## Create Azure credentials

Packer authenticates with Azure using a service principal. An Azure service principal is a security identity that you can use with apps, services, and automation tools like Packer. You control and define the permissions as to what operations the service principal can perform in Azure.

Create a service principal with [az ad sp create-for-rbac](/en-us/cli/azure/ad/sp) and output the credentials that Packer needs:

```
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role Contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<subscription_id> --query "{ client_id: appId, client_secret: password, tenant_id: tenant }"

```

An example of the output from the preceding commands is as follows:

```
{
    "client_id": "f5b6a5cf-fbdf-4a9f-b3b8-3c2cd00225a4",
    "client_secret": "0e760437-bf34-4aad-9f8d-870be799c55d",
    "tenant_id": "72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47"
}

```

To authenticate to Azure, you also need to obtain your Azure subscription ID with [az account show](/en-us/cli/azure/account):

```
az account show --query "{ subscription_id: id }"

```

You use the output from these two commands in the next step.

## Define Packer template

To build images, you create a template as a JSON file. In the template, you define builders and provisioners that carry out the actual build process. Packer has a [provisioner for Azure](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/plugins/builders/azure) that allows you to define Azure resources, such as the service principal credentials created in the preceding step.

Create a file named *ubuntu.json* and paste the following content. Enter your own values for the following parameters:

| Parameter | Where to obtain |
| --- | --- |
| *client\_id* | First line of output from `az ad sp` create command - *appId* |
| *client\_secret* | Second line of output from `az ad sp` create command - *password* |
| *tenant\_id* | Third line of output from `az ad sp` create command - *tenant* |
| *subscription\_id* | Output from `az account show` command |
| *managed\_image\_resource\_group\_name* | Name of resource group you created in the first step |
| *managed\_image\_name* | Name for the managed disk image that is created |

```

Note

Replace the `image_publisher`, `image_offer`, `image_sku` values and `inline` commands accordingly.

You can also create a filed named *ubuntu.pkr.hcl* and paste the following content with your own values as used for the above parameters table.

  vm_size                           = "Standard_DS2_v2"
}

build {
  sources = ["source.azure-arm.autogenerated_1"]

  provisioner "shell" {
    execute_command = "chmod +x {{ .Path }}; {{ .Vars }} sudo -E sh '{{ .Path }}'"
    inline          = ["apt-get update", "apt-get upgrade -y", "apt-get -y install nginx", "/usr/sbin/waagent -force -deprovision+user && export HISTSIZE=0 && sync"]
    inline_shebang  = "/bin/sh -x"

This template builds an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS image, installs NGINX, then deprovisions the VM.

Note

If you expand on this template to provision user credentials, adjust the provisioner command that deprovisions the Azure agent to read `-deprovision` rather than `deprovision+user`.
The `+user` flag removes all user accounts from the source VM.

## Build Packer image

If you don't already have Packer installed on your local machine, [follow the Packer installation instructions](https://www.packer.io/docs/install).

Build the image by specifying your Packer template file as follows:

```
sudo ./packer build ubuntu.json

```

You can also build the image by specifying the *ubuntu.pkr.hcl* file as follows:

```
sudo packer build ubuntu.pkr.hcl

```

An example of the output from the preceding commands is as follows:

```
azure-arm output will be in this color.

==> Builds finished. The artifacts of successful builds are:

```

It takes a few minutes for Packer to build the VM, run the provisioners, and clean up the deployment.

## Create VM from Azure Image

You can now create a VM from your Image with [az vm create](/en-us/cli/azure/vm). Specify the Image you created with the `--image` parameter. The following example creates a VM named *myVM* from *myPackerImage* and generates SSH keys if they don't already exist:

```
az vm create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myVM \
    --image myPackerImage \
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --generate-ssh-keys

```

If you wish to create VMs in a different resource group or region than your Packer image, specify the image ID rather than image name. You can obtain the image ID with [az image show](/en-us/cli/azure/image#az-image-show).

It takes a few minutes to create the VM. Once the VM has been created, take note of the `publicIpAddress` displayed by the Azure CLI. This address is used to access the NGINX site via a web browser.

To allow web traffic to reach your VM, open port 80 from the Internet with [az vm open-port](/en-us/cli/azure/vm):

```
az vm open-port \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myVM \
    --port 80

```

## Test VM and NGINX

Now you can open a web browser and enter `http://publicIpAddress` in the address bar. Provide your own public IP address from the VM create process. The default NGINX page is displayed as in the following example:

![NGINX default site](media/build-image-with-packer/nginx.png)

## Next steps

You can also use existing Packer provisioner scripts with [Azure Image Builder](image-builder).
