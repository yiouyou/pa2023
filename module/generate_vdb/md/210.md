This article shows you how to use [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io) to update packages on a Linux virtual machine (VM) or virtual machine scale sets at provisioning time in Azure. These cloud-init scripts run on first boot once the resources have been provisioned by Azure. For more information about how cloud-init works natively in Azure and the supported Linux distros, see [cloud-init overview](using-cloud-init)

## Update a VM with cloud-init

For security purposes, you may want to configure a VM to apply the latest updates on first boot. As cloud-init works across different Linux distros, there is no need to specify `apt`, `zypper` or `yum` for the package manager. Instead, you define `package_upgrade` and let the cloud-init process determine the appropriate mechanism for the distro in use.

For this example, we will be using the Azure Cloud Shell. To see the upgrade process in action, create a file named *cloud\_init\_upgrade.txt* and paste the following configuration. You can use any editor you wish. Make sure that the whole cloud-init file is copied correctly, especially the first line.

Copy the text below and paste it into the `cloud_init_upgrade.txt` file. Make sure that the whole cloud-init file is copied correctly, especially the first line.

```
#cloud-config
package_upgrade: true
packages:
- httpd

```

Before deploying, you need to create a resource group with the [az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group) command. An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location.

```
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus

```

Now, create a VM with [az vm create](/en-us/cli/azure/vm) and specify the cloud-init file with the `--custom-data` parameter as follows:

```
az vm create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name vmName \
  --image imageCIURN \
  --custom-data cloud_init_upgrade.txt \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --generate-ssh-keys 

```

Note

Replace **myResourceGroup**, **vmName**, and **imageCIURN** values accordingly. Make sure an image with Cloud-init is chosen.

SSH to the public IP address of your VM shown in the output from the preceding command. Enter your own **user** and **publicIpAddress** as follows:

```
ssh <user>@<publicIpAddress>

```

Run the package management tool and check for updates:

* [RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux](#tabpanel_1_rhel)
* [Ubuntu](#tabpanel_1_ubuntu)
* [SLES](#tabpanel_1_sles)

* Execute the following command to confirm there are no pending updates

```
sudo yum check-update

```

As cloud-init checked for and installed updates on boot, there should be no additional updates to apply.

* You can see the update process, number of altered packages as well as the installation of `httpd` by running the following command and review the output.

```
sudo yum history

```

```
ID     | Command line                                | Date and time    | Action(s)      | Altered
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     3 | -y install httpd                            | 2022-02-18 18:30 | Install        |    7
     2 | -y upgrade                                  | 2022-02-18 18:23 | I, O, U        |  321 EE
     1 |                                             | 2021-02-04 19:20 | Install        |  496 EE

```

* Execute the following command to confirm there are no pending updates

```
sudo apt -qq update
sudo apt list --upgradable

```

As cloud-init checked for and installed updates on boot, there should be no additional updates to apply.

* You can see the update process and altered packages by running the following command and reviewing the output

```
sudo cat /var/log/dpkg.log

```

* Execute the following command to confirm there are no pending updates

```
sudo zypper list-updates

```

As cloud-init checked for and installed updates on boot, there should be no additional updates to apply.

* You can see the update process and altered packages by running the following command and reviewing the output

```
sudo cat /var/log/zypp/history

```
